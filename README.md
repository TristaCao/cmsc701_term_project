For Searching using Boyer Moore or Shift-OR Algorithm with our experiment data, simply do `python main.py`. 

If you want to apply to new dataset with customized pattern, comment out `line 130` - `line 172` and uncomment `line 106` - `line 128` in `main.py`. Change the path file name in `line 106` and search pattern in `line 119` as you want. Then you can choose to run Boyer Moore algorithm with `line 122`, Shift-Or algorithm with tagged Huffman with `line 124`, or Shift-Or Algorithm with `line 126-128`.
