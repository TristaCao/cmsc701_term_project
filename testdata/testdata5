often excludes other types of sexual and reproductive health education such as birth control and safe sex Comprehensive sex education by contrast covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinenceEvidence does not support the effectiveness of abstinenceonly sex education It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing HIV risk in the developed world It does not decrease rates of sexual activity or unplanned pregnancy when compared to comprehensive sex educationThe topic of abstinenceonly education is controversial in the United States with proponents claiming that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity and critics arguing that abstinenceonly education is religiously motivated and that the approach has been proven ineffective and even detrimental to its own aimsAbstinence education teaches children and adolescents to abstain from sexual activity and that this is the only certain method of avoiding pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections STIs With a heavy focus on the importance of family values programs also teach that abstinence until marriage is a standard by which to liveSystematic reviews of research evaluating abstinenceonly sex education have concluded that it is ineffective at preventing unwanted pregnancy or the spread of STIs among other shortfallsA metaanalysis found that abstinencefocused programs had no effect on the likelihood of contracting STDsA Cochrane systematic review suggests that abstinenceonly education neither increases nor decreases HIV risk in highincome countries In the developing world there is a lack of evidence of effect In Douglas Kirby reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of abstinenceonly education programs and found little evidence to justify the use of such programs A metaanalysis found that it was ineffective at reducing the risk of HIV infection among adolescents Abstinence education has also been found to include misleading medical information and exclude potentially lifesaving information about sexual risk reduction A study found that statelevel abstinence education mandates have no effect on teen birth rates or abortion rates although we find that statelevel policies may affect teen sexually transmitted disease rates in some statesResearch conducted on states of United States showed that The level of abstinence education no provision covered promoted stressed was positively correlated with both teen pregnancy and teen birth rates Also in John S Santellis research the decline of teenage pregnancy rates during were largely due to improved contraception and the reduction in pregnancy risk among teenagers at age of or is entirely ascribed to more contraceptionAccording to SIECUS the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States scientific evidence simply does not support an abstinenceonlyuntilmarriage approach A report by the Guttmacher Institute pointed out that pregnancy rates for teens reversed their decline in near the peak of the Abstinence Only campaign in the United StatesWhile sex education has been linked to a delay in the first time having sex abstinenceonly programs specifically havent shown this link and do not seem to have an impact on if or when young people begin having sexProponents of abstinenceonly sex education argue that this approach is superior to comprehensive sex education because it emphasizes the teaching of morality that limits sex to that within the bounds of marriage and that sex before marriage and at a young age has heavy physical and emotional costs In addition abstinence programs often teach young people that pleasure in sex is most likely to be found within marriage and therefore that they should wait to engage in sexual activity until they are married Abstinence generally places a great emphasis on the importance of the institution of marriage which some proponents believe allows young people to grow and develop as individualsProponents suggest that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity among teenagers which should be discouraged in an era when HIV and other incurable STIs are widespread and when teen pregnancy is an ongoing concern Many supporters of abstinenceonly education do so out of the belief that comprehensive guides to sex or information about contraceptives will ultimately result in teens actively pursuing and engaging in sexual activities while others oppose the endorsement of contraception for religious reasons Teenagers are framed as less intelligent and less responsible than adults They are seen as unable to control themselves due to raging hormones As a result a teenagers sexual desire is something that needs to be controlled Thus dividing the teens into two separate categories in the minds of adults the innocent and the guilty the vulnerable and the predatory the pure and the corruptingOpponents and critics which include prominent professional associations in the fields of medicine public health adolescent health and psychology argue that such programs fail to provide adequate information to protect the health of adolescents Not only is information inadequate but opponents believe that young people have the right to receive comprehensive information about how to protect themselves and their sexual health Accurate information is especially important since although some supporters may claim that abstinence is an effective method it has been found that a small percentage of people actually practice itSome critics also argue that such programs verge on religious interference in secular education Opponents of abstinenceonly education dispute the claim that comprehensive sex education encourages teens to have premarital sex The idea that sexual intercourse should only occur within marriage also has serious implications for people for whom marriage is not valued or desired or is unavailable as an option particularly LGBT people living in places where samesex marriage is not legal or socially acceptable Abstinenceonly education is often criticized for being overly heteronormative idealizing the institution of heterosexual marriage to the denigration of queer relationships In addition the heteronormativity of abstinenceonly education as well as the focus on marriage means that members of the LGBT community will never receive formal information about how to practice safe sex which is problematic since they are already at an increased risk for STIsAccording to Advocates for Youth abstinenceonly sex education distorts information about contraceptives including only revealing failure rates associated with their use and ignoring discussion of their benefits The language surrounding medicine and health is construed as being both objective and value free This objectivity is then adopted by conservative politicians and campaigners to assert authority which historically holds its basis in religionAnother problem for abstinence education is the definition of abstinence Santelli states that there is no strict definition of abstinence within the US federal government guidelines for teaching abstinenceonly sex education using a mixture of nonspecific phrases like postponing sex or never had vaginal sex while also using moralistic terms or phrases like virgin chaste and making a commitment This has resulted in sexual activities that are not penilevaginal including mutual masturbation oral sex and anal sex being considered outside of the scope of abstention from sex which is termed technical virginityThe US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief PEPFAR is the US governments initiative to combat HIVAIDS globally PEPFAR works with the governments of countries worldwide to create sustainable programs to prevent HIV and improve the lives of those suffering PEPFAR provides funding to other countries to help combat HIVAIDS It does so with certain guidelines and restrictions on the recipients PEPFAR promotes an ABC approach Abstain Be faithful and use Condoms Funding recipients may give information about condoms to youth over years old but cannot use the funding to provide condoms or promote usage In countries receiving funds from PEPFAR teens under the age of are not allowed to receive information about condoms The rationale behind this is to not encourage sexual activity despite evidence that condom use does not cause promiscuityPEPFAR was founded in with the mandate that of its funds provided for prevention be used for abstinenceonly education Since the reauthorization in this mandate was removed with a shift toward directives to spend at least on abstinenceonly education The role of parters has been an area of debate surrounding PEPFAR In of all the community partners were faithbased and debate exists over whether the US should be allowing grants specifically written for faithbased organizations and prevention A few countries that have received PEPFAR funding specifically Mozambique and Rwanda have expressed distaste for the US push for faithbased education and abstinenceonly funding Human rights groups have expressed concern that condom availability has decreased since PEPFARs involvement in the global AIDS crisisThe billion that the US government spent on programs to promote abstinence in subSaharan Africa had no meaningful impactIn the US states may apply for federal funding of abstinenceonly sex education programs from either Title V the Adolescent Family Life Act AFLA andor CommunityBased Abstinence Education CBAE To be eligible for funding programs must satisfy requirements given under the Social Security Act which is reproduced here verbatim For purposes of this section the term abstinence education means an educational or motivational program whichFunding which began in the s has continued to increase since its inception though support for the programs and legislation surrounding them has become dependent upon the current administration For example George W Bush administration was supportive of abstinenceonly programs while the Obama administration has worked to decrease funding in order to provide more federal dollars for comprehensive sex educationThe Christian Right who initially stood against having schoolbased sex education programs began supporting abstinenceonly programs due to the focus on marriage As a driving force behind the abstinence movement they have focused on getting more funding for these programs and have also been successful in creating more awareness surrounding abstinence through their use of activism To the New Right the abstinenceonly sex education movement was an opportunity and an avenue to change the current view and status of sexuality in America aligning it more with their own values and as a result creating individuals who remained abstinent until marriage and thus citizens who embodied values of selfdiscipline and morality In addition abstinenceonly programs utilize ideas of individualism and personal responsibility when educating young people about sex seeking to create individuals who take responsibility for sexuality and morality These ideas underlie the basis of conservative ideology a focus on the individual having a strong place in the beliefs of this group Thus it makes sense that support for abstinenceonly programs as an effective form of sex education has been linked to conservative individualsReligious doctrines take varying stances on contraception and premarital sex some of which are covered bydocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid

name of the former Alcatraz penitentiary The coup consists of a deliberate revoke by declarer causing the next player to reveal whether he holds the key card whose location is sought The declarer then corrects the revoke which is allowed without penalty if done soon enough and the defender may change his play but declarer now knows about the key card and can choose how to finesse accordinglyConsider this layout of the club suitSouth wants three tricks from clubs but the opponents have been successful in concealing the location of the Q South calls for the J from dummy and East follows suit with the South now perpetrates the Alcatraz Coup by discarding from a different suit thus committing a revoke ThenPresumably the idea behind the name is that any bridge player attempting the coup should be locked up in a maximum security facility According to a article by Albert MoreheadThe classic hand for the Alcatraz Coup which was not then so called was the following one adduced in by Oswald Jacoby of Dallas who was trying to persuade the laws committees to change the revoke lawThus the name originates some time between and In a article in The Bridge World Kit Woolsey describes a fictitious visit by a bridge expert to a bridge tournament at Alcatraz where he was subject to various tricks by the inmates by means of gaming the system Apparently the coups name inspired Woolsey to write the articleAccording to Moreheads article The laws committees have considered the Alcatraz Coup too unusual a case to be dealt with specifically but it is no less typical of rare irregularities that committees must consider when a new code of laws is being prepared However since when that article was published there have been changes in the Laws so that now a remedy is available for use of the Alcatraz coupThe most relevant change is Law C Law D in the Laws Of Duplicate Bridge which defines information gained from either sides legal withdrawal of a card as unauthorized for the offending side Note although the revoking side may correct its revoke a revoke has nevertheless occurred and therefore there is an offending side It also states that A player of the offending side may not choose from among logical alternative actions one that could demonstrably have been suggested over another by the unauthorized information In other words even if the coup is executed inadvertently the declarer may not take advantage of knowing the position of the queen if he does so the tournament director may adjust the result accordinglyAlso a deliberate infraction of the Laws is normally viewed as a serious violation of the Proprieties that exposes deliberate attempters of the Coup to further sanctionsdocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid

threedimensional designs inside The image is composed of many small points of fracture or other visible deformations and appears to float inside the blockEach point is created by a laser beam focused to high intensity at that location by a computercontrolled optomechanical system A complex or highly detailed image occupying a cm inch cubic volume typically requires the creation of tens of thousands of such pointsBubblegram images may be created by intersecting laser beams in appropriately doped plastic to induce a chemical reaction via heat or photonic excitation creating bubbles or nodes where the plastic has a different index of refractionGlass block bubblegrams of Russian origin entered international commerce as a novelty in the late s but high prices and the predominantly simple inartistic subject matter severely limited market penetration In the early s a much less expensive more visually appealing and highly diverse array of Chinesemade bubblegram novelties achieved

identify people they know in common The game has become something of an informal social custom in the Jewish community and it is often surprisingly easy for strangers who play it to discover mutual acquaintances and establish instant context and connectionAs Etan Diamond observes in his book And I Will Dwell in Their Midst Orthodox Jews in SuburbiaThis game of Jewish geography follows a simple pattern One person asks Youre from insert name of city here Do you know insert persons name here The other one usually responds something like Sure he sits behind my uncle in synagogue or I met her once at a youth group convention or She is really good friends with my sisters college roommate NonJews often find it astonishing that such links are made so easily but given both the relative smallness of the Jewish communityand the even smaller size of the Orthodox Jewish communityand the extensive overlapping social circles within these communities it should not surprise too much p xvSonia Pressman Fuentes describes it in her memoir Eat FirstYou Dont Know What Theyll Give You The Adventures of an Immigrant Family and Their Feminist Daughter When two or more Jews meet who share a connection to a particular locality they will question each other until they find that they know or know of at least one other Jew in commonAn Israeli version of the game pitsuchim has been a common pastime among young Israeli backpackers traveling the world taking its name from a s television quiz showAnother similar social game called The rule of communicated Datis Hebrew for religious orthodox Jews is used by Zionist religious orthodox Jews and a movie mocking the game called by that name has been produced by students of the Maale school for video and mediaThe game is a form of testing the Smallworld experimentThe origins of Jewish geography are unclear Sarah Benor a linguist and professor of Jewish Studies at Hebrew Union College has noted Sometimes that kind of thing is really impossible to findThe term Jewish geography not only functions as the name of the game but also describes the unique smallness and closeness of the worldwide Jewish population The Jewish populations Jewish geography therefore is what makes the game possible and lets Jews from different cities regions and countries easily discover people they know in commonBoth the game and the concept are Jewishspecific examples of the six degrees of separation theory proposed by Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy in and the small world phenomenon hypothesized by social scientist Stanley Milgram in

marketing for the Skycatcher from their official website A total of aircraft were sold and the remaining unsold aircraft were used for parts until December when the balance were scrappedCessna had announced its intentions to study the feasibility of developing and producing an LSA on June The concept design was unveiled on July at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh as the Cessna LSA also referred to as the Cessna Sport via a marketing study of the feasibility of producing an aircraft compliant with the US Federal Aviation Administrations new LightSport Aircraft categoryOn October nine months after launching the program the concept prototype aircraft registered NCS first flew departing McConnell Air Force Base for Wichitas MidContinent Airport and reaching a speed of Cessna formally launched the Skycatcher program July following with a press event on July at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh that unveiled a fullscale mockup and details about the planned production versionThe conforming prototype had its first flight on March and the first initial production configuration aircraft flew on May The company carried out testing of the aircraft beyond the ASTM Light Sport Aircraft requirements including

delivered the first production Skycatcher to its initial customer Cessna CEO Jack Peltons wife Rose Pelton The company intended that the production rate would be to a year but only aircraft were delivered in By late droves of position holders had canceled their orders due to price increases and failure of the design to meet expectationsIn October at the National Business Aviation Association convention Cessna CEO Scott Ernest stated that the Cessna had no future Cessna Vice President Piston Aircraft Jodi Noah indicated that the aircraft had not met expectationsIn February sales were halted In December the remaining unsold s were scrapped These had been used to provide parts to keep the flying fleet goingIn analyzing the imminent end of Skycatcher production Paul Bertorelli of AVweb indicated that the reasons for ending production were high price poor useful load and lackluster flight performance compared to its LSA market competitorsIn a February review of the aircrafts history AVweb writer Geoff Rapoport blamed the aircrafts failure on an empty weight that was too high fragile construction and lack of cockpit space for taller pilots He stated the Skycatcher cant

price point Pelton predicted that Cessna would be able to sell of the aircraft per yearThe July announcement indicated that these price goals were not met The first aircraft ordered were sold for US The price was increased to US in and US in In November the company indicated that the price was being increased to US Part of the price increase was due to the incorporation of optional features as standard including the multifunction display intercom and sun visors About US of the increase was to improve company profits on the aircraft Russ Niles writing for AVweb noted The new price puts the Skycatcher at the upper end of the market for LSAs The price increase attracted aviation media attention Paul Bertorelli writing for AVweb concluded Only one thing mystifies me about this decision Cessna is the only LSA manufacturer well established with manufacturing in China If a company with Cessnas economy of scale and marketing acumen cant make an LSA more affordable by building it in China the notion of lowcost aircraft may very well be the myth that many people think it isThe price increase to US left the design priced well above its competition and also contractually allowed buyers who had deposits on the Cessna to cancel their orders and claim refunds which by the end of large numbers of position holders didOn November Cessna announced that the Cessna would be made in the Peoples Republic of China by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation which is a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corporation of China a Chinese governmentowned consortium of aircraft manufacturers By manufacturing the aircraft in China Cessna reported that it saved US in production costs per aircraft produced A second reason cited for moving production to Shenyang Aircraft Corporation was that Cessna at that time had no plant capacity available in the USAThe decision to produce the aircraft in China was controversial and Cessna received a high degree of negative feedback from Cessna customers and potential customersThe first production Cessna had its initial flight at Shenyang Aircraft in China on September Customer deliveries started in December In April the company was forced to refund deposits to a number of customers in Europe due to delays in gaining EASA certification The required both a type certificate and production certificate to be sold in Europe and at that point it had neitherIn July the company announced its solution that the design would be removed from the US lightsport category and moved to the primary aircraft category Primary category acceptance would have included type and production certificates and would have allow the aircraft to be sold in Europe after the certification was validated Primary Category certification was never completedThe Cessna s design has evolved considerably from the first prototype including the wing position and tail configuration The highwing monoplane has fixed tricycle landing gear with a castering nosewheel The wingspan is and internal cabin width is at shoulder height The doors are different from previous twoseat Cessna models in that they open by swinging upward The controls are unusual for a Cessna in that they have singlehand panelmounted yokes instead of the usual twohand panelmounted yokesThe aircrafts structure is mostly aluminum with a fiberglass cowling Cessna LSA Project head Neal Willford indicated in August that Cessna was investigating the use of match hole drilling to reduce costs and simplify construction of the design This technique is widely used in the kitplane industry and in construction of larger aircraft but would be Cessnas first use in its singleengine line On October Cessna announced that a Ballistic Recovery Systems airframe ballistic parachute system would be a factoryinstalled option on the Cessna While the initial proofofconcept aircraft flew with a Rotax S engine the production Cessna is powered by a direct drive aircooled carbureted Continental OD engine producing at rpm and equipped with a twoblade fixed pitch composite propeller With the OD engine the Skycatcher is capable of cruise at speeds as high as knots mph kmh with a maximum range of at a gross weight of lb kgThe Cessna is equipped for day and night VFR flying only Production aircraft were delivered with a Garmin G EFIS installed as well as a Garmin SL communications radio a GTX transponder and a MHz ELT Flight data is presented on the G in a single splitscreen combination primary flight display and multifunction display Information can also be shown on two fullscreen displays with installation of a second screen which were purchase options An autopilot and an audio panel were also available optionsThe Cessna has a maximum gross takeoff weight of and a standard empty weight of With a full fuel load of the payload remaining for crew and baggage is The standard empty weight does not include the fire extinguisher ELT wheel pants engine primer unusable fuel and many other items normally included One typical early production aircraft has an equipped weight of giving a full fuel payload of A nonconforming prototype Cessna registered NXP crashed on September in a treeline near Douglass Kansas approximately miles km southeast of Wichita Kansas The test pilot parachuted to safety and suffered only minor injuries The prototype had flown about hours prior to the accidentThe National Transportation Safety Board stated on September that the Cessna was registered in the experimental category and was conducting a test flight when the accident occurred The test sequence involved a series of stalls starting at The aircraft entered an unintentional flat spin and was not under control at at which point the test pilot bailed out of the aircraft Cessna confirmed that the entered a spin from crosscontrolled poweron stall that the spin became flat and recovery was not possible The company indicated that the testing was outside that required for LSA certification and that the accident will result in only small design changes The aircraft was equipped with a Ballistic Recovery Systems parachute but it failed to deploy when activatedDespite earlier claims that the design would undergo only small changes as a result of the crash of the prototype in late the received a redesigned vertical stabilizer The new fin is of greater area and less sweep than the original Cessna stated windtunnel testing of the new configuration showed that it now had no unrecoverable spin characteristics The redesigned tail was first flown on NCE the first productionconforming aircraft on December Another focus of the design changes was weight savings as a result the s seats were redesigned and the seat structure changed from composite to aluminum With the new larger fin the dorsal fin was unneeded and was deleted from the design to save weightNCE was involved in an accident during a test flight on March near Wichita Kansas During aggressive spin testing with power on and in a crosscontrolled condition the aircraft entered a rapid and disorienting spin and the test pilot was unable to recover control of the aircraft The test pilot successfully deployed the aircrafts ballistic recovery parachute which stopped the spin but despite being designed to be jettisonable could not be released from the aircraft Since the aircraft was too low for a bailout the pilot remained with the aircraft which crashlanded sustaining damage to the landing gear but left the pilot uninjured The pilot exited the aircraft and attempted to remove the parachute which remained attached to the aircraft Wind then dragged the aircraft into a fence leaving it inverted and heavily damaged The accident left Cessna with no flying Skycatcher aircraft in the testing programFollowing the crash of the second prototype a company spokesman stated that all the details about the programs future were under review by the company On March Cessna CEO Jack Pelton confirmed that the program would continue saying The need for a modern costeffective twoseat trainer aircraft has never been greater and we believe we are well positioned to meet that need The Skycatcher program is an important part of our strategyThe final production incorporated a thicker wing and further changes to the tail including a ventral fin to make the aircraft more resistant to spinsIn January the company announced that customer deliveries of production s would be delayed by six to ten months The company indicated that most of the delay was due to modifications required to aircraft produced by Shenyang Aircraft as a result of further spin testing and the earlier crashes of the prototypes The first production aircraft were delivered from China assembled by Cessna contractor Yingling Aviation and then modified by adding the ventral fin and decreasing the elevator and aileron travel In February the assembly of the plane was moved to Cessnas Independence Kansas factory ending Yinglings participation Cessna had planned to incorporate the airframe changes into the Chinese production lineIn November Cessna issued a Mandatory Service Bulletin MSB as a result of cracks found on its cyclic test aircraft The MSB requires addition of new wing ribs and modifications to the wing attachment structure for the first Cessna s delivered The modification was extensive and required manhours to complete and was required to be done within the next flight hours or at the next annual inspection whichever came first Cessna paid to modify all aircraft involvedIn December there were Skycatchers remaining on the US Federal Aviation Administration registrydocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid titleWhy That Doesnt Surprise MeWhy That Doesnt Surprise MeWhy That Doesnt

HopiMiwok writer Having grown up in an environment which placed little emphasis on her Native American background much of her verse deals with her search for her personal identity as a Native American She is also an anthropologist artist and social scientistAlso known under her pseudonym Chiron Khanshendel Wendy Rose is a poet nonfiction writer artist educator and anthropologist As a blend of all of these things Rose rejects marginalization and categorization but she is best known for her work as an American Indian poetWendy Rose was born Bronwen Elizabeth Edwards on May in Oakland California Though she is of Hopi and Miwok ancestry Rose was raised in a predominantly white community in San Francisco Growing up in an urban environment far removed from reservation life and Native American relations gave her little to no access to her native roots as a child A theme at the forefront of her poetry she comes from a mixedblood family Though her father is a fullblood Hopi Rose was denied membership in her fathers tribe because ancestry is determined matrilineally Her mother was partly Miwok but refused to acknowledge her American Indian heritage instead she acknowledged her European ancestry including English Scottish Irish and German extractionShe began making her own path as a young woman when she dropped out of high school to go to San Francisco and join the American Indian Movement AIM and took part in the protest occupation of Alcatraz During this time Rose spent time coming to terms with her ethnicity gender and an Indians place in the worldFrom to she began a new scholastic endeavor where she was enrolled in multiple colleges First she attended Cabrillo and Contra Costa Junior colleges Then in Rose enrolled at the University of California Berkeley While attending the university in she married Arthur Murata and earned her BA in anthropology in that same year Two years later she got her MA in and enrolled in the doctoral program During this period of her life Rose published five volumes of poetry and completed her PhD in anthropologyBesides the roles already mentioned of poet historian painter illustrator and anthropologist Wendy Rose is also a teacher researcher consultant editor panelist bibliographer and advisor Once she had returned to her schooling Rose did not leave the world of academia again and went on to teach Native American and Ethnic studies first at the University of California Berkeley from to then California State University Fresno from to and finally at her current position in Fresno City College in where she is the Coordinator of the American Indian Studies Program and edited the American Indian Quarterly Rose is a member of the American Federation of Teachers and has served as a facilitator for the Association of NonFederally Recognized California Tribes In addition she also serves on the Modern Languages Association Commission on Languages and Literatures of America Smithsonian Native Writers Series Womens Literature Project of Oxford University Press and Coordination Council of Literary MagazinesSome of the major themes explored in Wendy Roses works are themes relating to the Native American experience both specifically her own and also more broadly applied to other cultures of marginalization colonialism imperialism dependency nostalgia for the old ways reverence for grandparents resentment for conditions of the present plight of reservation and urban Indians sense of hopelessness the power of the trickster feminism as synonymous with heritage deadly compromise symbolism of all that has been lost such as land tension between the desire to retrieve the past and the inevitability of change arrogance of white people problems of halfbreeds or mixedbloodsOf course there are other themes many of which are related back to her life as an anthropologist Though she commonly shies away from her career as an anthropologist constantly stating that she isnt really one of them as she does in Neon Scars and her piece on whiteshamanism the reader is constantly reminded of her involvement in history and science through the poetrys imagery and historical epigraphsWhile any of these could be discussed at length one of the most prevalent themes Wendy Rose employs which ties together many of the other more obscure themes is the concept vividly expressed in the poem For the White poets who would be Indian discussed below known as whiteshamanism Whitshamanism is a term coined by the Cherokee critic Geary Hobson which he defined to be the apparently growing number of smallpress poets of generally white EuroChristian American background who in their poems assume the persona of the shaman usually in the guise of an American Indian medicine man To be a poet is simply not enough they must claim a power from higher sourcesBoth Hobson and Rose see this whiteshamanism as a modern sort of cultural imperialism In her discourse on whiteshamanism Just Whats All This Fuss About Whiteshamanism Anyway Rose compares a white man with no real blood connection to Native Americans calling himself a shaman to a man claiming to be a Rabbi who isnt JewishNative Americans view the whiteshaman with a mix of humor and contempt It is not just the simple act of going outside their culture that is upsetting to Native Americans but that they are misrepresenting the true Indian culture their images are shadows of the true Indian style Rose is opposed to the idea that through reading and hearing about Indian culture anyone can simply claim to be a spokesperson for the Native American experienceAs she puts it The problem with whiteshamans is one of integrity and intent not of topic style interest or experimentation Rose has no problem with other races writing about Native Americans and their history so long as it is written from their perspective and not from a falsely manufactured whiteshaman persona who simply asserts that they have the authority to talk about and understand the Native American experienceIn the introduction of her retrospective collection Bone Dance she states that the personal is political As scholar David Perron so eloquently puts it We come to understand that the diversity of Roses poetry is not about distinctions but about wholeness Her contempt for the whiteshaman is out of the lack of wholeness which they represent a wholeness which she has struggled to define in herself and her work As she was struggling to find her identity within her mixed lineage and culture using poetry to express herself the whiteshaman simply stole from her culture As her poetry bespeaks the position of injustice the whiteshaman spoke from a privileged position Thus as difficult as it is to summarize the works of Wendy Rose her writings on whiteshamanism bring together different strands of themes that appear throughout her poetryProbably her most wellknown and written about poem Truganinny is an example of Rose reaching out beyond the Native American experience and expanding it to the identity struggle experienced by other halfbreeds or outcasts in other racesThe epigraph which is the jumping off point for the poem tells the story of Truganinny the last Tasmanian who saw her husband stuffed mounted and put on display It was her dying wish that her body not also be subjected to those indignities after death Nevertheless her dying wish was ignored and she too was put on display for over yearsThe poem allows the reader to experience this her dying wish in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close and listen to what she has to say like a loved one and a confidence Yet the reader is struck by the fact that even as we read her final request we know it goes unhonored This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and additionally womenThis poem is directly related to the theme of whiteshamanism discussed above and based in Roses personal indignation toward nonNative Americans who claim to understand the Native American experience Rose takes the firm stance that it is not possible to understand something that one is not a part of She uses powerful images associated with native traditions and mentions them in a flippant matter practically throwing each image out painted faces doeskin etc and reflecting the way in which white Americans believe they can simply put on moccasins walk in them for a time and completely understand what it means to be an Indian She uses sarcasm and irony in the poem While many other poems of this kind can come off preachy and offensive Roses poem delivers a message and conveys her obvious emotional stake in the matter while at the same time managing to not come off as overlyemotional sermonizing In short this poem is Roses explanation of the hypocrisy of the whiteshamanIn no other poem does Rose manage of fuse inner turmoil and violence to make beauty so expertly as she does in I Expected My Skin and My Blood to Ripen Interweaving war and peace Rose brings the victims at wounded knee back to life again so we the reader and witness the items they owned being stripped from their bodies along with their flesh and their dignityThe poem starts with a passage about Wounded Knee about the burial of the bodies in a ditch as their items and possessions are sold off as art The poem reflects this irony of valuing items over human life as another of her poems reacts to the idea of Indian skeletons for cashSome of the most powerful images are of her as fallen fruit full of juice and pulp and flesh who like those Indians who were thrown into the ditch is peeled tasted and discardedShe talks of no future and no past as bayonets spear babies and beads are given away The image of the frozen feat is reminiscent of the trail that long journey where the Indians are all forced together pulled apart and then some were left behind they were just seen as cattle little more than fleshThe poem also contains an example of the theme of raping Indian women which is immediately followed by the image of a mother eating her child to save her from the world because theres not enough magic to stop the bullets Their faith and traditions cant stop the oppressionThe poem Notes on a Conspiracy is a powerful poem which begins with an excerpt about something excavated skulls The poem centers around the theme of white colonizationIt begins with the image of the antelopes dream and her eyes open for the great old visions of the cougar and bear but with rattlesnake as I pass and listen to her song The dream vision invokes images of traditional Indian culture which is further strengthened by the relation of the dream vision to animals closely associated with older Indian traditions and again by the theme of songShe mentions Extinction of her people like a species wiped out Then she gets more explicitly into the denouncing of colonialism and specifically Manifest Destiny She directly ties the colonizers to todays white America by calling them the skullmongers who are excavating the skulls of the dead Indians Her poetry sarcastically talks about how the colonials thought they had earned the right to the land because they traveled over the sea The Indians believed that the Americans should have come over bearing gifts but instead came only talking of land and moneyThen she asks where the strengths of old are Where are the dances It seems the only song now left is in her poetryThey blame us for their guilt They say we are a privileged few They say we gamble too much The way these lines are written reflect their meaning and make you feel like youre being told they blame they say they say etc This idea of shifting the blame for what happened to the Indians on the Indians is common and despicable It reflects the idea of the colonizers giving gifting land to the Indians as though they werent theirs in the first place Then they say that the Indians are so privileged but what privileges do they have when they are constantly prejudged for things like drinking and gamblingand now the scientist wonders at the bullet he lifts from the small soft place where my daughter sleeps Then she ends by tying all these images associated with the skulls back to the present by saying that the scientists findings arent ancient history but still have a direct impact on these people and their childrenWendy Rose has been one of the leading voices in resurgent Native American poetry for the past quarter of a centuryIn an interview with Joseph Bruchac she told him that she sees her task as storykeeper as she chronicles the sufferings of displaced peoples and biracial outcasts worldwide in addition to treating ecological and feminist issuesWendy Roses work is deeply rooted in ethnography and the living myths of Indian peoples Noted for verse detailing her search for tribal and personal identity much of Roses poetry examines the experiences of mixedblood Native Americans estranged from both native and white societies This stems from her own mixed heritage and search for identity Rose herself has said Everything I write is fundamentally autobiographical no mater what style or topic Yet unlike many current and conventional white poets her poems go beyond selfanalysis to focus on others caught between cultures like herselfAt the same time diversity is also apparent and expressed through multiple perspectives and covering a broad range of universally human experiencesIn her introduction to Bone Dance she tells us I have often been identified as a protest poet and although something in me frowns at being so neatly categorized that is largely the truth A huge element of her poetry is political which is also unsurprising knowing her involvement in AIM and other Native American movements As she puts it because the political is personal it becomes a part of the poetry whether intentionally so or notKnowing her background in anthropology and various Native American organizations it is not surprising that the most prevalent image in her poetry are bones In her poetry the image of battered bone is the direct link to native American sense of self The bones of dead Indians almost form the words on the page and are the spine holding together each of her volumes of poetry Stemming from her work with anthropology she writes about bones auctioned objects sold and bodies stuffed for our edification in a museum display Those dead Indians both form the phantoms that haunt her poetry and at the same time are given new life and the chance to speak out in her poetryBut perhaps the most incredible element Roses poetry is her ability to capture the hard truth behind the Native American experience and make it accessible to nonNative readersHer style is powerfully evocative and spare and she employs mostly free verse though aware of other forms Though for the most part she is a lyric poet traces of oral Indian tradition and the chant come through in her poetry As she says in her introduction to Bone Dance if the words cannot be sung in the genuine language of the old way they must be writtenAnother stylistic choice she makes is frequently beginning with an epigraph from the written records of the long assault on Native Peoples Often she uses this epigraph from the historical archeological world as a jumping off point for her poetry which is narrated by a Nativeidentified voice allowing for the reader to draw the connection between the two This juxtaposition brings the historical artifact of bone or cloth to life and we can see the skin being literally ripped away with the language of the poetry and giving the casual observer a real vision of that objectHer use of basic everyday language is a point of contention At first it can come across as simple but that simplicity of language allows for a greater range of emotion to come out in her work She explains this in her introduction to Bone Dance I never felt that it was enough to display agility with words or clever turns of phrase I believe that inaccessible poetry does not work If the listener must take a special class in how to appreciate it then the poem has failed I hold myself to that standard and try to remember that ordinary language contains all of the imagery and beauty needed by the poemEach of Wendy Roses collections of poetry represent a different phase in her life and a different set of experiences and can be linked to different points in her life which influenced each volume in a unique waydocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid

indentured workers brought to Fiji by the British as cheap labor for colonial sugarcane plantations Hindus along with Indian Muslims Christians and Sikhs started arriving in Fiji starting with through when slaverylike indenture system was abolished by Britain Some IndoFijians came to the island nation in the s and s Fiji identifies people as IndoFijians if they can trace their ancestry to the Indian subcontinent but not necessarily India Most of the Hindus in Fiji however are of Indian descentAccording to Census of Fiji of its population professed to be Hindus From late s through early s Fiji witnessed several coups and communal unrests where Hindus faced persecution in Fiji Many Hindus of Fiji emigrated to other countries A estimate suggests about Fijians were Hindus of its populationThe Hindu community in Fiji has built many temples schools and community centers over time Diwali is their primary festival of the yearFiji became part of the British colonial empire in Few years later in the British government brought the first Indians on coolie ships as indentured laborers to work in the sugarcane plantations of Fiji owned by British colonial officials By about Indians had been brought to Fiji with job advertisements and work contracts that promised Indians right to return or right to stay own land and live freely in Fiji after the year work contract period was over These contracts were called grimit phonetically derived from the English word agreementNearly of Indian origin people brought to Fiji as indentured laborers were Hindus others were Indian Muslims Indian Christians and Indian Sikhs The indentured laborers were poor escaping famines and poverty during the British colonial rule of India and brought to Fiji as part of a wave that saw human migration as cheap labor from India China and southeast Asian countries to plantations and mining operations in the Pacific Islands Africa Caribbean and South American nations About a fourth of the immigrants came from South India primarily Tamil Nadu while the remaining are from northern states primarily Uttar Pradesh but also from Bihar Jharkhand Haryana and Punjab each group bringing their own version of HinduismMany indentured Hindu laborers in Fiji preferred to return to India after their indentured labor contract was over Estimates suggest had returned by with higher return rates in early years In after nonviolent civil protests led by Gandhi against indenture system in British colonies around the world Britain abolished the system This stopped the inflow of new Indian labor into Fiji plantations while Indians continued to leave Fiji plantations The departure of productive low cost Indian labor became a serious labor shortage problem for the British plantations In the British colonial government granted IndoFijian Hindus electoral and some civil rights in most part to stabilize exports and profits from its Fijian sugar plantations and to prevent Indian laborers from leaving from the laborintensive plantations But the electoral rights granted were limited not proportional but racial quota based and the government segregated IndoFijians in a manner similar to South Africa that is on communal and racial basis from Europeans and native Fijians This system was resisted by the Hindus and in an act of peaceful protest Hindus refused to accept the segregated council However within years the Hindu community split along the lines of majority Sanatan Dharma group and a minority Arya Samaj group a situation that delayed further development of IndoFijian political rights A colleague of Gandhi A D Patel led independence initiative in Fiji demanding civil rights for all Fijians However the political segregation and unequal human rights for Hindus and other IndoFijians was retained in Fijis first Constitution as the British empire granted independence to its colony Fiji in According to Census of Fiji people or percent of Fijis population were of IndoFijian origins of which were Hindus In other words percent of Fijis population were Hindus After a period of persistent persecution from s and several coups which included burning of Hindu homes arson of temples and rape Fiji witnessed a wave of emigration of Hindus and other IndoFijians to Australia New Zealand United Kingdom Canada and India About of them emigrated after the coups between and alone The percentage population of Hindus in Fiji has declined since then both in total and in percentage termsAccording to the Republic of the Fiji Islands December estimate percent of the population of Fiji is IndoFijian and percent of IndoFijians are Hindus with the rest being Sikhs Muslims or Christians Therefore about percent of the population of Fiji is HinduThe Hindu population in Fiji is not uniformly distributed Population in some villages and towns such as Nadi and Nausori area have a Hindu majorityThe social structure among Fijian Hindus has lacked any caste structure Scholars suggest that this lack of formation or observance of caste system among Fijian Hindus may have been because of the nature of work in Fijian plantations where everyones profession revolved around farming because Fijian Hindus lived together from the time they arrived in coolie ships and because of demographic constraints faced by them Extensive exogamy has been observed among Hindus of Fiji since the earliest days of plantation settlements just like in other major indentured Hindu labor settlements in Mauritius Natal South Africa and the CaribbeanAs with South Africa the British colonial officials segregated people by race in Fiji Plantation settlements in Fiji as a policy considered IndoFijian Hindus as a worker class and did not allow them to live near or with European settlers nor mix with native Fijian people The segregation created a culture contact problem that worsened over time During the time of colonial rule all the indigenous Fijians were proselytised and converted en masse to Christianity mostly Methodism by missionaries from Europe mainly the British Isles The IndoFijian Hindus however largely refused to convert and the great majority have remained Hindus to this very dayFijian Hindus celebrate Rama Navami Holi and Diwali Of these Diwali is a public holiday in FijiIn the first half of th century Holi was the principal festival for Hindus of Fiji Thereafter Diwali gained prominence After Fiji gained independence from British rule Diwali has eclipsed all other Hindu festivals and is now the principal Fijian Hindu festival John Kelly suggests that this may reflect sociopolitical situation in Fiji the segregation faced by Hindus as they demanded equal political rights with European residents and native Fijian people This shift in cultural milieu among Hindus in Fiji posits Kelly may be because Holi is a transcendenceoriented all inclusive extrospective festival while Diwali is a perfectionoriented devotionalism and introspective festivalAmong the Hindus of Fiji any kind of work including physical labor in farms is culturally considered a form of puja prayer and religious offeringHindus began building temples after their arrival in Fiji These served as venues for marriages annual religious festivals family prayers after the death of loved ones and other social events The Hindu temples were constructed both in northern and southern Indian styles The Shiu Hindu temple at Nadawar in Nadi for example was built in however this temple was destroyed in an arson attack and communal violence against Hindus in Sri Siva Subramaniya Hindu Temple in Nadi is the largest Hindu temple in FijiIn addition to temples Hindus built schools and community centers to improve the social and educational opportunities For example Kuppuswami Naidu a devotee of Swami Vivekananda and who later was known as Sadhu Swami visited various islands of Fiji and met diverse Hindu communities particularly from South India to start the TISI Sangam initiative This community effort over time created schools nursing clinics community assistance in farm technologies temples and a community centerhistory museum for Hindu people in FijiIndoFijians were called upon to join the cause of allied forces during World War II Over Hindus in Fiji served with millions of soldiers from Australia New Zealand India and other British colonies during the war IndoFijians served in Asia and Europe during the World War IIBy the time Fiji gained independence from the British colonial empire Hindus and other IndoFijians constituted nearly fiftypercent of the total Fijian population Nevertheless the colonial era laws and the first constitution for Fiji granted special rights to native Fijians These laws relegated Hindus as unequal citizens of Fiji with unequal human rights For example it denied them property rights such as the ability to buy or own land Hindus and other IndoFijians have since then not enjoyed equal human rights as other Fijians They can only work as tenant farmers for Fijian landlords The difference in human rights has been a continuing source of conflict between native Fijians and IndoFijians with native Fijians believing Fiji to be their ancestral land that only they can own and IndoFijians demanding equal rights for all human beingsBeyond land ownership Hindus have been persecuted in the Fijian communal structure Spike Boydell states the British introduced the divisive and unworkable system of communal representation and communal electoral rolls Thus different communities were represented by their own kind This still extends to schooling in a prevailing quasi apartheid educational systemDuring the late s Fiji witnessed a series of riots by radical native Fijians against Hindus and other IndoFijians In the spring of the democratically elected Fijian government led by Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry was held hostage by a group headed by George Speight They demanded a segregated state exclusively for the native Fijians thereby legally abolishing any human rights the Hindu inhabitants have Hindu owned shops Hindu schools and temples were destroyed vandalized and lootedThe Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma and particularly Sitiveni Rabuka who led the coup in Fiji called for the creation of a Christian State and endorsed forceful conversion of Hindus after a coup dtat in In Fiji Methodist Churchs president Tuikilakila Waqairatu called for Fiji to officially declare Christianity as the state religion the Hindu community leaders demanded that Fiji be a secular state where

with one two or three bench seats They are suitable for fishing and hunting The hull of a jon boat is nearly flat therefore it tends to ride over the waves rather than cut through them as a Vhull might thus limiting the use of the boat to calmer waters Jon boats typically have a transom onto which an outboard motor can be mounted They are simple and easy to maintain and inexpensive with many options to upgrade Typical options might include live wellsbait wells side or center consoles factory installed decks and floors electrical wiring accessory padsmountings casting and poling platformsJon boats with beefed up aluminum construction and powered by jetdrive outboards are capable of operating in extremely shallow water and thus are used frequently in rocky rivers and areas with submerged obstructions such as oyster bars and coral Jon boats are available commercially between long and wide though custom sizes may be found The simple design includes an open hull without a bilge leaving the ribs exposed Many individuals choose to cover the ribs producing a flat level surfaceThe Wasserwacht branch of the German Red Cross has chosen jon boats for their civil protection units for use during floodsIn the late th century flatbottom boats were found popular in The Ozarks and were ideal for traversing the shallow waters in the Missouri Valley As a result people of that region began referring to the boat as the Ozark John BoatThe boats were found useful for float fishing duck hunting and carrying timber Visiting tourists and travellers enjoyed the idea of flatbottomed boats as they could fish standing up and did not have to fear tipping overDuring the early th century the Ozark John Boat saw many advancements in its construction and design As the boat

and along with Cerros de Amotape National Park and El Angolo Game Preserve is part of the Noroeste Biosphere Reserve designated by UNESCOIn the Peruvian government created the Tumbes National Forest with an area of hectares to promote the rational exploitation of the forest resources However wood extraction was an important activity in the area since the s and the forest was already heavily exploitedIn a law prohibiting wood extraction except for very mature trees in Tumbes was passedUNESCO declared the Tumbes National Forest as part of the Noroeste Biosphere Reserve in In the government creates by a decree the Tumbes Reserved Zone in the former area of the Tumbes National Forest The aims of the creation of the reserved zone were to protect a representative area of the Pacific tropical forest and its threatened flora and faunaOn July the Peruvian government declared part of the area as the Tumbes National Reserve The area with the highest conservation priority was merged into Cerros de Amotape National Park while the remaining area was declared compatible with traditional land use and defined as spanning The area is characterized by a hilly terrain with some flat areas It is covered with seasonally dry forest and tropical forest due to the more humid climate resulting from marine currents and atmospheric factorsThe climate in the reserve is subtropical influenced some years by the El Nio phenomenon and the average annual precipitation is mm Temperatures range from C during summer peak in February to April to C in winter peak in July and AugustThe dominant vegetation type in the reserve is the seasonally dry tropical forest Among the tree species found in this protected area are hualtaco Loxopterygium huasango ceibo Ceiba trischistandra algarrobo Prosopis spp angolo Albizia multiflora quipo Cavanillesia platanifolia guayacn Tabebuia sp and palo santo Bursera graveolensAmong the mammals protected in the reserve are the mantled howler

commodities obtained from forests which do not require harvesting logging trees They include game animals furbearers nuts seeds berries mushrooms oils foliage medicinal plants peat fuelwood fish spices and forageResearch on NTFPs have focused on their commodifiability for rural incomes and markets as an expression of traditional knowledge or as a livelihood option for rural household needs and as a key component of sustainable forest management and conservation strategies All research promote forest products as valuable commodities and tools that can promote the conservation of forestsThere is a wide variety of NTFPs including mushrooms huckleberries ferns transplants seed cones pion seeds tree nuts moss maple syrup cork cinnamon rubber tree oils and resins and ginseng The United Kingdoms Forestry Commission defines NTFPs as any biological resources found in woodlands except timber and Forest Harvest part of the Reforesting Scotland project defines them as materials supplied by woodlands except the conventional harvest of timber These definitions include wild and managed game fish and insects NTFPs are commonly grouped into categories such as floral greens decoratives medicinal plants foods flavors and fragrances fibers and saps and resinsOther terms similar to NTFPs include special nonwood minor alternative and secondary forest products NTFPs in particular highlight forest products which are of value to local people and communities but have been overlooked in the wake of forest management priorities for example timber production and animal forage In recent decades interest has grown in using NTFPs as alternatives or supplements to forest management practices In some forest types under the right political and social conditions forests can be managed to increase NTFP diversity and consequently to increase biodiversity and potentially economic diversity Black truffle cultivation in the mediterranean area is a good example of a high profitability when well managedThe harvest of NTFPs remains widespread throughout the world People from a wide range of socioeconomic geographical and cultural contexts harvest NTFPs for a number of purposes including but not limited to household subsistence maintenance of cultural and familial traditions spiritual fulfillment as well as physical and emotional wellbeing house heating and cooking animal feeding indigenous medicine and healing scientific learning and income Other terms synonymous with harvesting include wildcrafting gathering collecting and foraging NTFPs also serve as raw materials for industries ranging from largescale floral greens suppliers and pharmaceutical companies to microenterprises centred upon a wide variety of activities such as basketmaking woodcarving and the harvest and processing of various medicinal plantsIt is difficult to estimate the contribution of NTFPs to national or regional economies as there is a lack of broadbased systems for tracking the combined value of the hundreds of products that make up various NTFP industries One exception to this is the maple syrup industry which in in the US alone yielded worth USD million In temperate forests such as in the US wild edible mushrooms such as matsutake medicinal plants such as ginseng and floral greens such as salal and sword fern are multimilliondollar industries While these highvalue species may attract the most attention a diversity of NTFPs can be found in most forests of the worldIn tropical forests for example NTFPs can be an important source of income that can supplement farming andor other activities A valueanalysis of the Amazon rainforest in Peru found that exploitation of NTFPs could yield higher net revenue per hectare than would timber harvest of the same area while still conserving vital ecological services Their economic cultural and ecological value when considered in aggregate makes managing NTFPs an important component of sustainable forest management and the conservation of biological and cultural diversityMinority people in Vietnam Myanmar and Laos are living away from the mainstream settlements The hill tribes and many other minority groups are closely associated with forests for centuries Much of their household subsistence and part of the income is generated from the sale of a variety of NTFP products In the Highlands of Vietnam NTFPs calendar is spread almost throughout the year that provides a sustained income for the ethnic minority people From June to August is the wild berry called Uoi Scaphium macropodium collection that provides the bulk of household income Every family sends several people into the forest on a regular basis during this period where they stay for days during which kg of berries is collected A kilogram of dried berries days of sundry is sold for The next comes bamboo shoots mushrooms and vegetable collection that goes through to February The minority people in Sa Pa area depends mainly on a variety of NTFPs for their livelihoods Among the products collected are fruits berries leaves mushrooms fish bees honey bamboo shoots wild orchids and the list goes on The Friday market is full of orchids and other wild plants put forward by these people for the tourists both domestic and international that flock there Between of the total household income is derived from the sale of NTFPs The harvesting of leaves in the diet of family goes round the year where different species are readily available in specific months Water from forest areas is yet another service that is useful in the livelihoods of these people They have microhydro plants installed in streams that generate the much needed power for pounding grain and seeds and lighting tooIn the drier areas of Sri Lanka the harvesting of curry leaves to be sold to traders is an important income The harvesting of velvet tamarind Dialium ovoideum is an important income source to the rural people This tree which is endemic to the country provides a fruit that has a highpopularity during certain months of the year The returns from the sale of these two products is an important addition to the household incomes of rural peopleResearch on NTFPs have focused on three perspectives NTFPs as a commodity with a focus on rural incomes and markets as an expression of traditional knowledge or as a livelihood option for rural household needs and finally as a key component of sustainable forest management and conservation strategies These perspectives promote forest products as valuable commodities and important tools that can promote the conservation of forests In some contexts the gathering and use of NTFPs can be a mechanism for poverty alleviation and local developmentdocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid

Sydney funnelweb spider Atrax robustusDelta atracotoxin produces potentially fatal neurotoxic symptoms in primates by slowing the inactivation of sodium ion channels in autonomic and motor neurons In the spiders intended insect prey the toxin exerts this same activity upon potassium and calcium ion channelsThe structure of atracotoxin comprises a core beta region with a cystine knot motif a feature seen in other neurotoxic polypeptidesSince records are kept of envenomations by the Sydney funnelweb spider and deaths have been reported in medical literature between and when the antivenom became available In all cases in which the sex of the spider was determined death occurred after a bite from a male spiderDelta atracotoxin is a residue peptide toxin The amino acid sequence of delta atracotoxin is unusual in that it contains three consecutive cysteine residues at positions The amino acid sequence of delta atracotoxin isCysteine bridges exist between Cys and Cys Cys and Cys Cys and Cys and Cys and CysThe structure consists of a small triplestranded betasheet stabilized by a disulfide knot followed by a Cterminal extension comprising three classic or inverse yturns The disulfide knot is a ring consisting of two disulfide bonds and and the connecting backbone through which a third disulfide bond passes The sheet defined on the basis of intersheet hydrogen bonds consists of residues strand I strand II and strand III with a topology of x The two hydrogen bonds one amide of which has a slowly exchanging amide proton between strands I and III are distorted NH to CO distance between and A There are four hydrogen bonds between strands II and III all of which have corresponding slowly exchanging amide protons three being present in most of the structures and one in half of the structuresThe structure contains a number of chain reversals The first is not well defined and is either a type II turn LysAsn or a yturn centered on Arg Chain reversal II is a y turn centered on Gly Chain reversal III is not well defined being either a type I turn AsnnCys or an inverse yturn centered on Asn Chain reversal IV CysMet is not stabilized by a hydrogen bond but has a cis peptide bond between Cys and Pro and resembles a type Via turn The fifth chain reversal occurs in the region of residues which fulfill the criteria for an iloop The Cterminal extension stabilized by the CysCys disulfide bond consists of three yturns VIVIII that are respectively an inverse turn centered on Thr a classic turn centered on Ile and an inverse turn centered on Phe All three of the yturn hydrogen bonds have slowly exchanging amide protons although this is not the case for the other turns The only slowly exchanging amide proton not accounted for by consensus hydrogen bonds in any secondary structure element is that of Gly which hydrogen bonds to Thr in one of the structuresThe conformations of the CysCys and CysCys disulfide bonds are well defined and have negative and positive Xss respectively the other two bonds have lower order parameters The hydrophobic core of RBX is limited consisting of essentially the disulfide knot cystine residues and the buried Met However the loop contains one apolar residue Ala and three aromatics Tyr Trp and Tyr and is flanked by Ile at its Nterminus and Trp near its Cterminus so this region represents a significant nonpolar surface on the molecule RBX is highly positively charged with one Arg sequence position and six Lys and residues balanced only by Glu and Asp These charged residues form three patches on the surface Patch A consists of the positively charged residues and patch B of residues and the Nterminus including possible salt bridges between Lys and Glu and Asp and the Nterminus and patch C of and the CterminusDelta atracotoxin is responsible for the potentially lethal envenomation syndrome seen following funnelweb spider envenomation dAtracotoxins induce spontaneous repetitive firing and prolongation of action potentials resulting in continuous acetylcholine neurotransmitter release from somatic and autonomic nerve endings This will lead to slower voltagegated sodium channel inactivation and a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltagedependence of activation This action is due to voltagedependent binding to neurotoxin receptor site in a similar but not identical fashion to scorpion atoxins and sea anemone toxinsIn the sea anemone and scorpion toxins combinations of charged especially cationic and hydrophobic sidechains are important for binding to their receptor site site on the sodium channel It will therefore be not surprising to find that the same applies to delta atracotoxin and versutoxin a close homologue of delta atracotoxin Delta atracotoxin presents three distinct charged patches on its surface as well as a nonpolar region centered on the loop Both of these structural features may play a role in its binding to the voltagegated sodium channel but further studies are necessary in defining which residues are important for interaction with the sodium channel so that a plausible model can be constructed of its binding siteThe availability of synthetic toxin has allowed scientist to further explore the biological activity of the toxin resulting in the observation that dACTXAra causes repetitive firing and prolongation of the action potential These actions underlie the clinical symptoms seen during envenomation and further contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis for activity of this potent neurotoxin on voltagegated sodium channelsUnder voltageclamp conditions in dorsal root ganglion DRG neurons is found that the effects of the synthetic toxin on sodium currents were not significantly different from those previously reported for the native toxin Neither native nor synthetic dACTXAra had any effect on TTXresistant sodium currents but both exerted a potent selective modulation of TTXsensitive sodium currents consistent with actions on neurotoxin receptor site This includes a slowing of the sodiumchannel inactivation a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltagedependence of activation and a hyperpolarizing shift in the steadystate sodiumchannel inactivationdACTXAra causes a prolongation of action potential duration accompanied by spontaneous repetitive firing but does not depolarize the resting membrane potential Effects on the autonomic nervous system including vomiting profuse sweating salivation lachrymation marked hypertension followed by hypotension together with effect on the somatic nervous system to cause muscle fasciculation and dyspnoea are presumably due to excessive transmitter release To identify the sodiumchannel binding surface of dACTXAra scientist must synthesize analogues with selected residue changes Studies will contribute to a more detailed mapping of site the neurotoxin receptor site on the sodiumchannel and provide structureactivity data critical for determining the phylaspecific actions of this and related atracotoxinsThe bite of a Sydney funnel web spider is at first painful due to the large fangs and acidic pH of the venom If there is no immediate treatment symptoms may arise beginning minutes after the bite Hypertension may occur which is often followed by a prolonged hypotension and circulatory failure Other symptoms include dyspnea and ultimately respiratory failure generalized skeletal muscle fasciculation salivation lachrymation sweating nausea vomiting diarrhoea pulmonary edema and painThe progress of the envenomation is precisely studied in primates which symptoms are very similar to those of humans In the first minutes after envenomation disturbances in respiration occurred which gradually became worse Some monkeys required artificial ventilation Initially the blood pressure decreased but then quickly rose after which the blood pressure gradually declined After minutes severe hypotension occurredLachrymation started after minutes and was followed by salivation These symptoms were most severe during minutes after envenomationSkeletal muscle fasciculation started after minutes and reached its peak between minutes It was accompanied with an increase in body temperatureEnvenomation with the male venom produced mostly the same symptoms although the onset of the symptoms was a little delayed The female venom also produces the same symptoms but far less severeThe toxicity of the spiders venom is affected by the sex of the spider The male funnelweb spiders venom appears to be six times more powerful than that of the female spider based on minimum lethal dose determinations In addition different species of animals tend to react to the venom in various ways For example rats rabbits and cats are unaffected by the bite of a female funnelweb spider whereas for percent of mice and guinea pigs the bite of a female was fatal A bite of a male funnelweb spider though led to the death of almost all mice and guinea pigs Although the male spiders venom seems to be more potent male spider bites cause mild transient effects in dogs and cats Most primates including humans appear to be extremely sensitive to the funnelweb spiders venomThe values have been determined in mice for male spider venom mgkg body weight of the mouse and for female spider venom mgkg body weight were found The LD value of pure delta atracotoxin which was isolated from a male spider mgkg body weight was foundThe antivenom was developed by a team headed by Struan Sutherland at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne Since the antivenom became available in there have been no recorded fatalities from Sydney funnelweb spider bites In September it was reported that stocks of antivenom were running low and members of the public were asked to catch the spiders so that they could be milked for their venom The venom is taken from the spiders by delicately stroking their fangs and collecting the tiny droplets of deadly poison The venom is needed to produce the antivenom One dose of antivenom requires around milkings from a spiderFunnel web spider antivenom is prepared from the plasma of rabbits immunized with the venom of the male funnel web spider Atrax robustus Each vial of the product contains units of antivenom which has been standardized to neutralize mg of funnel web spider venom The product also contains glycine and other rabbit plasma proteinsFunnel web spider antivenom is a purified immunoglobulin mainly immunoglobulin G derived from rabbit plasma which contains specific antibodies against the toxic substances in the venom of the funnel web spider Atrax robustus There is evidence to show that the antivenom is effective in the treatment of patients bitten by
