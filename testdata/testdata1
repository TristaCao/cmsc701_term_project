often excludes other types of sexual and reproductive health education such as birth control and safe sex Comprehensive sex education by contrast covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinenceEvidence does not support the effectiveness of abstinenceonly sex education It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing HIV risk in the developed world It does not decrease rates of sexual activity or unplanned pregnancy when compared to comprehensive sex educationThe topic of abstinenceonly education is controversial in the United States with proponents claiming that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity and critics arguing that abstinenceonly education is religiously motivated and that the approach has been proven ineffective and even detrimental to its own aimsAbstinence education teaches children and adolescents to abstain from sexual activity and that this is the only certain method of avoiding pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections STIs With a heavy focus on the importance of family values programs also teach that abstinence until marriage is a standard by which to liveSystematic reviews of research evaluating abstinenceonly sex education have concluded that it is ineffective at preventing unwanted pregnancy or the spread of STIs among other shortfallsA metaanalysis found that abstinencefocused programs had no effect on the likelihood of contracting STDsA Cochrane systematic review suggests that abstinenceonly education neither increases nor decreases HIV risk in highincome countries In the developing world there is a lack of evidence of effect In Douglas Kirby reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of abstinenceonly education programs and found little evidence to justify the use of such programs A metaanalysis found that it was ineffective at reducing the risk of HIV infection among adolescents Abstinence education has also been found to include misleading medical information and exclude potentially lifesaving information about sexual risk reduction A study found that statelevel abstinence education mandates have no effect on teen birth rates or abortion rates although we find that statelevel policies may affect teen sexually transmitted disease rates in some statesResearch conducted on states of United States showed that The level of abstinence education no provision covered promoted stressed was positively correlated with both teen pregnancy and teen birth rates Also in John S Santellis research the decline of teenage pregnancy rates during were largely due to improved contraception and the reduction in pregnancy risk among teenagers at age of or is entirely ascribed to more contraceptionAccording to SIECUS the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States scientific evidence simply does not support an abstinenceonlyuntilmarriage approach A report by the Guttmacher Institute pointed out that pregnancy rates for teens reversed their decline in near the peak of the Abstinence Only campaign in the United StatesWhile sex education has been linked to a delay in the first time having sex abstinenceonly programs specifically havent shown this link and do not seem to have an impact on if or when young people begin having sexProponents of abstinenceonly sex education argue that this approach is superior to comprehensive sex education because it emphasizes the teaching of morality that limits sex to that within the bounds of marriage and that sex before marriage and at a young age has heavy physical and emotional costs In addition abstinence programs often teach young people that pleasure in sex is most likely to be found within marriage and therefore that they should wait to engage in sexual activity until they are married Abstinence generally places a great emphasis on the importance of the institution of marriage which some proponents believe allows young people to grow and develop as individualsProponents suggest that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity among teenagers which should be discouraged in an era when HIV and other incurable STIs are widespread and when teen pregnancy is an ongoing concern Many supporters of abstinenceonly education do so out of the belief that comprehensive guides to sex or information about contraceptives will ultimately result in teens actively pursuing and engaging in sexual activities while others oppose the endorsement of contraception for religious reasons Teenagers are framed as less intelligent and less responsible than adults They are seen as unable to control themselves due to raging hormones As a result a teenagers sexual desire is something that needs to be controlled Thus dividing the teens into two separate categories in the minds of adults the innocent and the guilty the vulnerable and the predatory the pure and the corruptingOpponents and critics which include prominent professional associations in the fields of medicine public health adolescent health and psychology argue that such programs fail to provide adequate information to protect the health of adolescents Not only is information inadequate but opponents believe that young people have the right to receive comprehensive information about how to protect themselves and their sexual health Accurate information is especially important since although some supporters may claim that abstinence is an effective method it has been found that a small percentage of people actually practice itSome critics also argue that such programs verge on religious interference in secular education Opponents of abstinenceonly education dispute the claim that comprehensive sex education encourages teens to have premarital sex The idea that sexual intercourse should only occur within marriage also has serious implications for people for whom marriage is not valued or desired or is unavailable as an option particularly LGBT people living in places where samesex marriage is not legal or socially acceptable Abstinenceonly education is often criticized for being overly heteronormative idealizing the institution of heterosexual marriage to the denigration of queer relationships In addition the heteronormativity of abstinenceonly education as well as the focus on marriage means that members of the LGBT community will never receive formal information about how to practice safe sex which is problematic since they are already at an increased risk for STIsAccording to Advocates for Youth abstinenceonly sex education distorts information about contraceptives including only revealing failure rates associated with their use and ignoring discussion of their benefits The language surrounding medicine and health is construed as being both objective and value free This objectivity is then adopted by conservative politicians and campaigners to assert authority which historically holds its basis in religionAnother problem for abstinence education is the definition of abstinence Santelli states that there is no strict definition of abstinence within the US federal government guidelines for teaching abstinenceonly sex education using a mixture of nonspecific phrases like postponing sex or never had vaginal sex while also using moralistic terms or phrases like virgin chaste and making a commitment This has resulted in sexual activities that are not penilevaginal including mutual masturbation oral sex and anal sex being considered outside of the scope of abstention from sex which is termed technical virginityThe US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief PEPFAR is the US governments initiative to combat HIVAIDS globally PEPFAR works with the governments of countries worldwide to create sustainable programs to prevent HIV and improve the lives of those suffering PEPFAR provides funding to other countries to help combat HIVAIDS It does so with certain guidelines and restrictions on the recipients PEPFAR promotes an ABC approach Abstain Be faithful and use Condoms Funding recipients may give information about condoms to youth over years old but cannot use the funding to provide condoms or promote usage In countries receiving funds from PEPFAR teens under the age of are not allowed to receive information about condoms The rationale behind this is to not encourage sexual activity despite evidence that condom use does not cause promiscuityPEPFAR was founded in with the mandate that of its funds provided for prevention be used for abstinenceonly education Since the reauthorization in this mandate was removed with a shift toward directives to spend at least on abstinenceonly education The role of parters has been an area of debate surrounding PEPFAR In of all the community partners were faithbased and debate exists over whether the US should be allowing grants specifically written for faithbased organizations and prevention A few countries that have received PEPFAR funding specifically Mozambique and Rwanda have expressed distaste for the US push for faithbased education and abstinenceonly funding Human rights groups have expressed concern that condom availability has decreased since PEPFARs involvement in the global AIDS crisisThe billion that the US government spent on programs to promote abstinence in subSaharan Africa had no meaningful impactIn the US states may apply for federal funding of abstinenceonly sex education programs from either Title V the Adolescent Family Life Act AFLA andor CommunityBased Abstinence Education CBAE To be eligible for funding programs must satisfy requirements given under the Social Security Act which is reproduced here verbatim For purposes of this section the term abstinence education means an educational or motivational program whichFunding which began in the s has continued to increase since its inception though support for the programs and legislation surrounding them has become dependent upon the current administration For example George W Bush administration was supportive of abstinenceonly programs while the Obama administration has worked to decrease funding in order to provide more federal dollars for comprehensive sex educationThe Christian Right who initially stood against having schoolbased sex education programs began supporting abstinenceonly programs due to the focus on marriage As a driving force behind the abstinence movement they have focused on getting more funding for these programs and have also been successful in creating more awareness surrounding abstinence through their use of activism To the New Right the abstinenceonly sex education movement was an opportunity and an avenue to change the current view and status of sexuality in America aligning it more with their own values and as a result creating individuals who remained abstinent until marriage and thus citizens who embodied values of selfdiscipline and morality In addition abstinenceonly programs utilize ideas of individualism and personal responsibility when educating young people about sex seeking to create individuals who take responsibility for sexuality and morality These ideas underlie the basis of conservative ideology a focus on the individual having a strong place in the beliefs of this group Thus it makes sense that support for abstinenceonly programs as an effective form of sex education has been linked to conservative individualsReligious doctrines take varying stances on contraception and premarital sex some of which are covered bydocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid

name of the former Alcatraz penitentiary The coup consists of a deliberate revoke by declarer causing the next player to reveal whether he holds the key card whose location is sought The declarer then corrects the revoke which is allowed without penalty if done soon enough and the defender may change his play but declarer now knows about the key card and can choose how to finesse accordinglyConsider this layout of the club suitSouth wants three tricks from clubs but the opponents have been successful in concealing the location of the Q South calls for the J from dummy and East follows suit with the South now perpetrates the Alcatraz Coup by discarding from a different suit thus committing a revoke ThenPresumably the idea behind the name is that any bridge player attempting the coup should be locked up in a maximum security facility According to a article by Albert MoreheadThe classic hand for the Alcatraz Coup which was not then so called was the following one adduced in by Oswald Jacoby of Dallas who was trying to persuade the laws committees to change the revoke lawThus the name originates some time between and In a article in The Bridge World Kit Woolsey describes a fictitious visit by a bridge expert to a bridge tournament at Alcatraz where he was subject to various tricks by the inmates by means of gaming the system Apparently the coups name inspired Woolsey to write the articleAccording to Moreheads article The laws committees have considered the Alcatraz Coup too unusual a case to be dealt with specifically but it is no less typical of rare irregularities that committees must consider when a new code of laws is being prepared However since when that article was published there have been changes in the Laws so that now a remedy is available for use of the Alcatraz coupThe most relevant change is Law C Law D in the Laws Of Duplicate Bridge which defines information gained from either sides legal withdrawal of a card as unauthorized for the offending side Note although the revoking side may correct its revoke a revoke has nevertheless occurred and therefore there is an offending side It also states that A player of the offending side may not choose from among logical alternative actions one that could demonstrably have been suggested over another by the unauthorized information In other words even if the coup is executed inadvertently the declarer may not take advantage of knowing the position of the queen if he does so the tournament director may adjust the result accordinglyAlso a deliberate infraction of the Laws is normally viewed as a serious violation of the Proprieties that exposes deliberate attempters of the Coup to further sanctionsdocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid

threedimensional designs inside The image is composed of many small points of fracture or other visible deformations and appears to float inside the blockEach point is created by a laser beam focused to high intensity at that location by a computercontrolled optomechanical system A complex or highly detailed image occupying a cm inch cubic volume typically requires the creation of tens of thousands of such pointsBubblegram images may be created by intersecting laser beams in appropriately doped plastic to induce a chemical reaction via heat or photonic excitation creating bubbles or nodes where the plastic has a different index of refractionGlass block bubblegrams of Russian origin entered international commerce as a novelty in the late s but high prices and the predominantly simple inartistic subject matter severely limited market penetration In the early s a much less expensive more visually appealing and highly diverse array of Chinesemade bubblegram novelties achieved

identify people they know in common The game has become something of an informal social custom in the Jewish community and it is often surprisingly easy for strangers who play it to discover mutual acquaintances and establish instant context and connectionAs Etan Diamond observes in his book And I Will Dwell in Their Midst Orthodox Jews in SuburbiaThis game of Jewish geography follows a simple pattern One person asks Youre from insert name of city here Do you know insert persons name here The other one usually responds something like Sure he sits behind my uncle in synagogue or I met her once at a youth group convention or She is really good friends with my sisters college roommate NonJews often find it astonishing that such links are made so easily but given both the relative smallness of the Jewish communityand the even smaller size of the Orthodox Jewish communityand the extensive overlapping social circles within these communities it should not surprise too much p xvSonia Pressman Fuentes describes it in her memoir Eat FirstYou Dont Know What Theyll Give You The Adventures of an Immigrant Family and Their Feminist Daughter When two or more Jews meet who share a connection to a particular locality they will question each other until they find that they know or know of at least one other Jew in commonAn Israeli version of the game pitsuchim has been a common pastime among young Israeli backpackers traveling the world taking its name from a s television quiz showAnother similar social game called The rule of communicated Datis Hebrew for religious orthodox Jews is used by Zionist religious orthodox Jews and a movie mocking the game called by that name has been produced by students of the Maale school for video and mediaThe game is a form of testing the Smallworld experimentThe origins of Jewish geography are unclear Sarah Benor a linguist and professor of Jewish Studies at Hebrew Union College has noted Sometimes that kind of thing is really impossible to findThe term Jewish geography not only functions as the name of the game but also describes the unique smallness and closeness of the worldwide Jewish population The Jewish populations Jewish geography therefore is what makes the game possible and lets Jews from different cities regions and countries easily discover people they know in commonBoth the game and the concept are Jewishspecific examples of the six degrees of separation theory proposed by Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy in and the small world phenomenon hypothesized by social scientist Stanley Milgram in

marketing for the Skycatcher from their official website A total of aircraft were sold and the remaining unsold aircraft were used for parts until December when the balance were scrappedCessna had announced its intentions to study the feasibility of developing and producing an LSA on June The concept design was unveiled on July at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh as the Cessna LSA also referred to as the Cessna Sport via a marketing study of the feasibility of producing an aircraft compliant with the US Federal Aviation Administrations new LightSport Aircraft categoryOn October nine months after launching the program the concept prototype aircraft registered NCS first flew departing McConnell Air Force Base for Wichitas MidContinent Airport and reaching a speed of Cessna formally launched the Skycatcher program July following with a press event on July at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh that unveiled a fullscale mockup and details about the planned production versionThe conforming prototype had its first flight on March and the first initial production configuration aircraft flew on May The company carried out testing of the aircraft beyond the ASTM Light Sport Aircraft requirements including

delivered the first production Skycatcher to its initial customer Cessna CEO Jack Peltons wife Rose Pelton The company intended that the production rate would be to a year but only aircraft were delivered in By late droves of position holders had canceled their orders due to price increases and failure of the design to meet expectationsIn October at the National Business Aviation Association convention Cessna CEO Scott Ernest stated that the Cessna had no future Cessna Vice President Piston Aircraft Jodi Noah indicated that the aircraft had not met expectationsIn February sales were halted In December the remaining unsold s were scrapped These had been used to provide parts to keep the flying fleet goingIn analyzing the imminent end of Skycatcher production Paul Bertorelli of AVweb indicated that the reasons for ending production were high price poor useful load and lackluster flight performance compared to its LSA market competitorsIn a February review of the aircrafts history AVweb writer Geoff Rapoport blamed the aircrafts failure on an empty weight that was too high fragile construction and lack of cockpit space for taller pilots He stated the Skycatcher cant

price point Pelton predicted that Cessna would be able to sell of the aircraft per yearThe July announcement indicated that these price goals were not met The first aircraft ordered were sold for US The price was increased to US in and US in In November the company indicated that the price was being increased to US Part of the price increase was due to the incorporation of optional features as standard including the multifunction display intercom and sun visors About US of the increase was to improve company profits on the aircraft Russ Niles writing for AVweb noted The new price puts the Skycatcher at the upper end of the market for LSAs The price increase attracted aviation media attention Paul Bertorelli writing for AVweb concluded Only one thing mystifies me about this decision Cessna is the only LSA manufacturer well established with manufacturing in China If a company with Cessnas economy of scale and marketing acumen cant make an LSA more affordable by building it in China the notion of lowcost aircraft may very well be the myth that many people think it isThe price increase to US left the design priced well above its competition and also contractually allowed buyers who had deposits on the Cessna to cancel their orders and claim refunds which by the end of large numbers of position holders didOn November Cessna announced that the Cessna would be made in the Peoples Republic of China by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation which is a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corporation of China a Chinese governmentowned consortium of aircraft manufacturers By manufacturing the aircraft in China Cessna reported that it saved US in production costs per aircraft produced A second reason cited for moving production to Shenyang Aircraft Corporation was that Cessna at that time had no plant capacity available in the USAThe decision to produce the aircraft in China was controversial and Cessna received a high degree of negative feedback from Cessna customers and potential customersThe first production Cessna had its initial flight at Shenyang Aircraft in China on September Customer deliveries started in December In April the company was forced to refund deposits to a number of customers in Europe due to delays in gaining EASA certification The required both a type certificate and production certificate to be sold in Europe and at that point it had neitherIn July the company announced its solution that the design would be removed from the US lightsport category and moved to the primary aircraft category Primary category acceptance would have included type and production certificates and would have allow the aircraft to be sold in Europe after the certification was validated Primary Category certification was never completedThe Cessna s design has evolved considerably from the first prototype including the wing position and tail configuration The highwing monoplane has fixed tricycle landing gear with a castering nosewheel The wingspan is and internal cabin width is at shoulder height The doors are different from previous twoseat Cessna models in that they open by swinging upward The controls are unusual for a Cessna in that they have singlehand panelmounted yokes instead of the usual twohand panelmounted yokesThe aircrafts structure is mostly aluminum with a fiberglass cowling Cessna LSA Project head Neal Willford indicated in August that Cessna was investigating the use of match hole drilling to reduce costs and simplify construction of the design This technique is widely used in the kitplane industry and in construction of larger aircraft but would be Cessnas first use in its singleengine line On October Cessna announced that a Ballistic Recovery Systems airframe ballistic parachute system would be a factoryinstalled option on the Cessna While the initial proofofconcept aircraft flew with a Rotax S engine the production Cessna is powered by a direct drive aircooled carbureted Continental OD engine producing at rpm and equipped with a twoblade fixed pitch composite propeller With the OD engine the Skycatcher is capable of cruise at speeds as high as knots mph kmh with a maximum range of at a gross weight of lb kgThe Cessna is equipped for day and night VFR flying only Production aircraft were delivered with a Garmin G EFIS installed as well as a Garmin SL communications radio a GTX transponder and a MHz ELT Flight data is presented on the G in a single splitscreen combination primary flight display and multifunction display Information can also be shown on two fullscreen displays with installation of a second screen which were purchase options An autopilot and an audio panel were also available optionsThe Cessna has a maximum gross takeoff weight of and a standard empty weight of With a full fuel load of the payload remaining for crew and baggage is The standard empty weight does not include the fire extinguisher ELT wheel pants engine primer unusable fuel and many other items normally included One typical early production aircraft has an equipped weight of giving a full fuel payload of A nonconforming prototype Cessna registered NXP crashed on September in a treeline near Douglass Kansas approximately miles km southeast of Wichita Kansas The test pilot parachuted to safety and suffered only minor injuries The prototype had flown about hours prior to the accidentThe National Transportation Safety Board stated on September that the Cessna was registered in the experimental category and was conducting a test flight when the accident occurred The test sequence involved a series of stalls starting at The aircraft entered an unintentional flat spin and was not under control at at which point the test pilot bailed out of the aircraft Cessna confirmed that the entered a spin from crosscontrolled poweron stall that the spin became flat and recovery was not possible The company indicated that the testing was outside that required for LSA certification and that the accident will result in only small design changes The aircraft was equipped with a Ballistic Recovery Systems parachute but it failed to deploy when activatedDespite earlier claims that the design would undergo only small changes as a result of the crash of the prototype in late the received a redesigned vertical stabilizer The new fin is of greater area and less sweep than the original Cessna stated windtunnel testing of the new configuration showed that it now had no unrecoverable spin characteristics The redesigned tail was first flown on NCE the first productionconforming aircraft on December Another focus of the design changes was weight savings as a result the s seats were redesigned and the seat structure changed from composite to aluminum With the new larger fin the dorsal fin was unneeded and was deleted from the design to save weightNCE was involved in an accident during a test flight on March near Wichita Kansas During aggressive spin testing with power on and in a crosscontrolled condition the aircraft entered a rapid and disorienting spin and the test pilot was unable to recover control of the aircraft The test pilot successfully deployed the aircrafts ballistic recovery parachute which stopped the spin but despite being designed to be jettisonable could not be released from the aircraft Since the aircraft was too low for a bailout the pilot remained with the aircraft which crashlanded sustaining damage to the landing gear but left the pilot uninjured The pilot exited the aircraft and attempted to remove the parachute which remained attached to the aircraft Wind then dragged the aircraft into a fence leaving it inverted and heavily damaged The accident left Cessna with no flying Skycatcher aircraft in the testing programFollowing the crash of the second prototype a company spokesman stated that all the details about the programs future were under review by the company On March Cessna CEO Jack Pelton confirmed that the program would continue saying The need for a modern costeffective twoseat trainer aircraft has never been greater and we believe we are well positioned to meet that need The Skycatcher program is an important part of our strategyThe final production incorporated a thicker wing and further changes to the tail including a ventral fin to make the aircraft more resistant to spinsIn January the company announced that customer deliveries of production s would be delayed by six to ten months The company indicated that most of the delay was due to modifications required to aircraft produced by Shenyang Aircraft as a result of further spin testing and the earlier crashes of the prototypes The first production aircraft were delivered from China assembled by Cessna contractor Yingling Aviation and then modified by adding the ventral fin and decreasing the elevator and aileron travel In February the assembly of the plane was moved to Cessnas Independence Kansas factory ending Yinglings participation Cessna had planned to incorporate the airframe changes into the Chinese production lineIn November Cessna issued a Mandatory Service Bulletin MSB as a result of cracks found on its cyclic test aircraft The MSB requires addition of new wing ribs and modifications to the wing attachment structure for the first Cessna s delivered The modification was extensive and required manhours to complete and was required to be done within the next flight hours or at the next annual inspection whichever came first Cessna paid to modify all aircraft involvedIn December there were Skycatchers remaining on the US Federal Aviation Administration registrydocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid titleWhy That Doesnt Surprise MeWhy That Doesnt Surprise MeWhy That Doesnt

HopiMiwok writer Having grown up in an environment which placed little emphasis on her Native American background much of her verse deals with her search for her personal identity as a Native American She is also an anthropologist artist and social scientistAlso known under her pseudonym Chiron Khanshendel Wendy Rose is a poet nonfiction writer artist educator and anthropologist As a blend of all of these things Rose rejects marginalization and categorization but she is best known for her work as an American Indian poetWendy Rose was born Bronwen Elizabeth Edwards on May in Oakland California Though she is of Hopi and Miwok ancestry Rose was raised in a predominantly white community in San Francisco Growing up in an urban environment far removed from reservation life and Native American relations gave her little to no access to her native roots as a child A theme at the forefront of her poetry she comes from a mixedblood family Though her father is a fullblood Hopi Rose was denied membership in her fathers tribe because ancestry is determined matrilineally Her mother was partly Miwok but refused to acknowledge her American Indian heritage instead she acknowledged her European ancestry including English Scottish Irish and German extractionShe began making her own path as a young woman when she dropped out of high school to go to San Francisco and join the American Indian Movement AIM and took part in the protest occupation of Alcatraz During this time Rose spent time coming to terms with her ethnicity gender and an Indians place in the worldFrom to she began a new scholastic endeavor where she was enrolled in multiple colleges First she attended Cabrillo and Contra Costa Junior colleges Then in Rose enrolled at the University of California Berkeley While attending the university in she married Arthur Murata and earned her BA in anthropology in that same year Two years later she got her MA in and enrolled in the doctoral program During this period of her life Rose published five volumes of poetry and completed her PhD in anthropologyBesides the roles already mentioned of poet historian painter illustrator and anthropologist Wendy Rose is also a teacher researcher consultant editor panelist bibliographer and advisor Once she had returned to her schooling Rose did not leave the world of academia again and went on to teach Native American and Ethnic studies first at the University of California Berkeley from to then California State University Fresno from to and finally at her current position in Fresno City College in where she is the Coordinator of the American Indian Studies Program and edited the American Indian Quarterly Rose is a member of the American Federation of Teachers and has served as a facilitator for the Association of NonFederally Recognized California Tribes In addition she also serves on the Modern Languages Association Commission on Languages and Literatures of America Smithsonian Native Writers Series Womens Literature Project of Oxford University Press and Coordination Council of Literary MagazinesSome of the major themes explored in Wendy Roses works are themes relating to the Native American experience both specifically her own and also more broadly applied to other cultures of marginalization colonialism imperialism dependency nostalgia for the old ways reverence for grandparents resentment for conditions of the present plight of reservation and urban Indians sense of hopelessness the power of the trickster feminism as synonymous with heritage deadly compromise symbolism of all that has been lost such as land tension between the desire to retrieve the past and the inevitability of change arrogance of white people problems of halfbreeds or mixedbloodsOf course there are other themes many of which are related back to her life as an anthropologist Though she commonly shies away from her career as an anthropologist constantly stating that she isnt really one of them as she does in Neon Scars and her piece on whiteshamanism the reader is constantly reminded of her involvement in history and science through the poetrys imagery and historical epigraphsWhile any of these could be discussed at length one of the most prevalent themes Wendy Rose employs which ties together many of the other more obscure themes is the concept vividly expressed in the poem For the White poets who would be Indian discussed below known as whiteshamanism Whitshamanism is a term coined by the Cherokee critic Geary Hobson which he defined to be the apparently growing number of smallpress poets of generally white EuroChristian American background who in their poems assume the persona of the shaman usually in the guise of an American Indian medicine man To be a poet is simply not enough they must claim a power from higher sourcesBoth Hobson and Rose see this whiteshamanism as a modern sort of cultural imperialism In her discourse on whiteshamanism Just Whats All This Fuss About Whiteshamanism Anyway Rose compares a white man with no real blood connection to Native Americans calling himself a shaman to a man claiming to be a Rabbi who isnt JewishNative Americans view the whiteshaman with a mix of humor and contempt It is not just the simple act of going outside their culture that is upsetting to Native Americans but that they are misrepresenting the true Indian culture their images are shadows of the true Indian style Rose is opposed to the idea that through reading and hearing about Indian culture anyone can simply claim to be a spokesperson for the Native American experienceAs she puts it The problem with whiteshamans is one of integrity and intent not of topic style interest or experimentation Rose has no problem with other races writing about Native Americans and their history so long as it is written from their perspective and not from a falsely manufactured whiteshaman persona who simply asserts that they have the authority to talk about and understand the Native American experienceIn the introduction of her retrospective collection Bone Dance she states that the personal is political As scholar David Perron so eloquently puts it We come to understand that the diversity of Roses poetry is not about distinctions but about wholeness Her contempt for the whiteshaman is out of the lack of wholeness which they represent a wholeness which she has struggled to define in herself and her work As she was struggling to find her identity within her mixed lineage and culture using poetry to express herself the whiteshaman simply stole from her culture As her poetry bespeaks the position of injustice the whiteshaman spoke from a privileged position Thus as difficult as it is to summarize the works of Wendy Rose her writings on whiteshamanism bring together different strands of themes that appear throughout her poetryProbably her most wellknown and written about poem Truganinny is an example of Rose reaching out beyond the Native American experience and expanding it to the identity struggle experienced by other halfbreeds or outcasts in other racesThe epigraph which is the jumping off point for the poem tells the story of Truganinny the last Tasmanian who saw her husband stuffed mounted and put on display It was her dying wish that her body not also be subjected to those indignities after death Nevertheless her dying wish was ignored and she too was put on display for over yearsThe poem allows the reader to experience this her dying wish in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close and listen to what she has to say like a loved one and a confidence Yet the reader is struck by the fact that even as we read her final request we know it goes unhonored This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and additionally womenThis poem is directly related to the theme of whiteshamanism discussed above and based in Roses personal indignation toward nonNative Americans who claim to understand the Native American experience Rose takes the firm stance that it is not possible to understand something that one is not a part of She uses powerful images associated with native traditions and mentions them in a flippant matter practically throwing each image out painted faces doeskin etc and reflecting the way in which white Americans believe they can simply put on moccasins walk in them for a time and completely understand what it means to be an Indian She uses sarcasm and irony in the poem While many other poems of this kind can come off preachy and offensive Roses poem delivers a message and conveys her obvious emotional stake in the matter while at the same time managing to not come off as overlyemotional sermonizing In short this poem is Roses explanation of the hypocrisy of the whiteshamanIn no other poem does Rose manage of fuse inner turmoil and violence to make beauty so expertly as she does in I Expected My Skin and My Blood to Ripen Interweaving war and peace Rose brings the victims at wounded knee back to life again so we the reader and witness the items they owned being stripped from their bodies along with their flesh and their dignityThe poem starts with a passage about Wounded Knee about the burial of the bodies in a ditch as their items and possessions are sold off as art The poem reflects this irony of valuing items over human life as another of her poems reacts to the idea of Indian skeletons for cashSome of the most powerful images are of her as fallen fruit full of juice and pulp and flesh who like those Indians who were thrown into the ditch is peeled tasted and discardedShe talks of no future and no past as bayonets spear babies and beads are given away The image of the frozen feat is reminiscent of the trail that long journey where the Indians are all forced together pulled apart and then some were left behind they were just seen as cattle little more than fleshThe poem also contains an example of the theme of raping Indian women which is immediately followed by the image of a mother eating her child to save her from the world because theres not enough magic to stop the bullets Their faith and traditions cant stop the oppressionThe poem Notes on a Conspiracy is a powerful poem which begins with an excerpt about something excavated skulls The poem centers around the theme of white colonizationIt begins with the image of the antelopes dream and her eyes open for the great old visions of the cougar and bear but with rattlesnake as I pass and listen to her song The dream vision invokes images of traditional Indian culture which is further strengthened by the relation of the dream vision to animals closely associated with older Indian traditions and again by the theme of songShe mentions Extinction of her people like a species wiped out Then she gets more explicitly into the denouncing of colonialism and specifically Manifest Destiny She directly ties the colonizers to todays white America by calling them the skullmongers who are excavating the skulls of the dead Indians Her poetry sarcastically talks about how the colonials thought they had earned the right to the land because they traveled over the sea The Indians believed that the Americans should have come over bearing gifts but instead came only talking of land and moneyThen she asks where the strengths of old are Where are the dances It seems the only song now left is in her poetryThey blame us for their guilt They say we are a privileged few They say we gamble too much The way these lines are written reflect their meaning and make you feel like youre being told they blame they say they say etc This idea of shifting the blame for what happened to the Indians on the Indians is common and despicable It reflects the idea of the colonizers giving gifting land to the Indians as though they werent theirs in the first place Then they say that the Indians are so privileged but what privileges do they have when they are constantly prejudged for things like drinking and gamblingand now the scientist wonders at the bullet he lifts from the small soft place where my daughter sleeps Then she ends by tying all these images associated with the skulls back to the present by saying that the scientists findings arent ancient history but still have a direct impact on these people and their childrenWendy Rose has been one of the leading voices in resurgent Native American poetry for the past quarter of a centuryIn an interview with Joseph Bruchac she told him that she sees her task as storykeeper as she chronicles the sufferings of displaced peoples and biracial outcasts worldwide in addition to treating ecological and feminist issuesWendy Roses work is deeply rooted in ethnography and the living myths of Indian peoples Noted for verse detailing her search for tribal and personal identity much of Roses poetry examines the experiences of mixedblood Native Americans estranged from both native and white societies This stems from her own mixed heritage and search for identity Rose herself has said Everything I write is fundamentally autobiographical no mater what style or topic Yet unlike many current and conventional white poets her poems go beyond selfanalysis to focus on others caught between cultures like herselfAt the same time diversity is also apparent and expressed through multiple perspectives and covering a broad range of universally human experiencesIn her introduction to Bone Dance she tells us I have often been identified as a protest poet and although something in me frowns at being so neatly categorized that is largely the truth A huge element of her poetry is political which is also unsurprising knowing her involvement in AIM and other Native American movements As she puts it because the political is personal it becomes a part of the poetry whether intentionally so or notKnowing her background in anthropology and various Native American organizations it is not surprising that the most prevalent image in her poetry are bones In her poetry the image of battered bone is the direct link to native American sense of self The bones of dead Indians almost form the words on the page and are the spine holding together each of her volumes of poetry Stemming from her work with anthropology she writes about bones auctioned objects sold and bodies stuffed for our edification in a museum display Those dead Indians both form the phantoms that haunt her poetry and at the same time are given new life and the chance to speak out in her poetryBut perhaps the most incredible element Roses poetry is her ability to capture the hard truth behind the Native American experience and make it accessible to nonNative readersHer style is powerfully evocative and spare and she employs mostly free verse though aware of other forms Though for the most part she is a lyric poet traces of oral Indian tradition and the chant come through in her poetry As she says in her introduction to Bone Dance if the words cannot be sung in the genuine language of the old way they must be writtenAnother stylistic choice she makes is frequently beginning with an epigraph from the written records of the long assault on Native Peoples Often she uses this epigraph from the historical archeological world as a jumping off point for her poetry which is narrated by a Nativeidentified voice allowing for the reader to draw the connection between the two This juxtaposition brings the historical artifact of bone or cloth to life and we can see the skin being literally ripped away with the language of the poetry and giving the casual observer a real vision of that objectHer use of basic everyday language is a point of contention At first it can come across as simple but that simplicity of language allows for a greater range of emotion to come out in her work She explains this in her introduction to Bone Dance I never felt that it was enough to display agility with words or clever turns of phrase I believe that inaccessible poetry does not work If the listener must take a special class in how to appreciate it then the poem has failed I hold myself to that standard and try to remember that ordinary language contains all of the imagery and beauty needed by the poemEach of Wendy Roses collections of poetry represent a different phase in her life and a different set of experiences and can be linked to different points in her life which influenced each volume in a unique waydocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid
