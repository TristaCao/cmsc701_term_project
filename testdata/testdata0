often excludes other types of sexual and reproductive health education such as birth control and safe sex Comprehensive sex education by contrast covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinenceEvidence does not support the effectiveness of abstinenceonly sex education It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing HIV risk in the developed world It does not decrease rates of sexual activity or unplanned pregnancy when compared to comprehensive sex educationThe topic of abstinenceonly education is controversial in the United States with proponents claiming that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity and critics arguing that abstinenceonly education is religiously motivated and that the approach has been proven ineffective and even detrimental to its own aimsAbstinence education teaches children and adolescents to abstain from sexual activity and that this is the only certain method of avoiding pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections STIs With a heavy focus on the importance of family values programs also teach that abstinence until marriage is a standard by which to liveSystematic reviews of research evaluating abstinenceonly sex education have concluded that it is ineffective at preventing unwanted pregnancy or the spread of STIs among other shortfallsA metaanalysis found that abstinencefocused programs had no effect on the likelihood of contracting STDsA Cochrane systematic review suggests that abstinenceonly education neither increases nor decreases HIV risk in highincome countries In the developing world there is a lack of evidence of effect In Douglas Kirby reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of abstinenceonly education programs and found little evidence to justify the use of such programs A metaanalysis found that it was ineffective at reducing the risk of HIV infection among adolescents Abstinence education has also been found to include misleading medical information and exclude potentially lifesaving information about sexual risk reduction A study found that statelevel abstinence education mandates have no effect on teen birth rates or abortion rates although we find that statelevel policies may affect teen sexually transmitted disease rates in some statesResearch conducted on states of United States showed that The level of abstinence education no provision covered promoted stressed was positively correlated with both teen pregnancy and teen birth rates Also in John S Santellis research the decline of teenage pregnancy rates during were largely due to improved contraception and the reduction in pregnancy risk among teenagers at age of or is entirely ascribed to more contraceptionAccording to SIECUS the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States scientific evidence simply does not support an abstinenceonlyuntilmarriage approach A report by the Guttmacher Institute pointed out that pregnancy rates for teens reversed their decline in near the peak of the Abstinence Only campaign in the United StatesWhile sex education has been linked to a delay in the first time having sex abstinenceonly programs specifically havent shown this link and do not seem to have an impact on if or when young people begin having sexProponents of abstinenceonly sex education argue that this approach is superior to comprehensive sex education because it emphasizes the teaching of morality that limits sex to that within the bounds of marriage and that sex before marriage and at a young age has heavy physical and emotional costs In addition abstinence programs often teach young people that pleasure in sex is most likely to be found within marriage and therefore that they should wait to engage in sexual activity until they are married Abstinence generally places a great emphasis on the importance of the institution of marriage which some proponents believe allows young people to grow and develop as individualsProponents suggest that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity among teenagers which should be discouraged in an era when HIV and other incurable STIs are widespread and when teen pregnancy is an ongoing concern Many supporters of abstinenceonly education do so out of the belief that comprehensive guides to sex or information about contraceptives will ultimately result in teens actively pursuing and engaging in sexual activities while others oppose the endorsement of contraception for religious reasons Teenagers are framed as less intelligent and less responsible than adults They are seen as unable to control themselves due to raging hormones As a result a teenagers sexual desire is something that needs to be controlled Thus dividing the teens into two separate categories in the minds of adults the innocent and the guilty the vulnerable and the predatory the pure and the corruptingOpponents and critics which include prominent professional associations in the fields of medicine public health adolescent health and psychology argue that such programs fail to provide adequate information to protect the health of adolescents Not only is information inadequate but opponents believe that young people have the right to receive comprehensive information about how to protect themselves and their sexual health Accurate information is especially important since although some supporters may claim that abstinence is an effective method it has been found that a small percentage of people actually practice itSome critics also argue that such programs verge on religious interference in secular education Opponents of abstinenceonly education dispute the claim that comprehensive sex education encourages teens to have premarital sex The idea that sexual intercourse should only occur within marriage also has serious implications for people for whom marriage is not valued or desired or is unavailable as an option particularly LGBT people living in places where samesex marriage is not legal or socially acceptable Abstinenceonly education is often criticized for being overly heteronormative idealizing the institution of heterosexual marriage to the denigration of queer relationships In addition the heteronormativity of abstinenceonly education as well as the focus on marriage means that members of the LGBT community will never receive formal information about how to practice safe sex which is problematic since they are already at an increased risk for STIsAccording to Advocates for Youth abstinenceonly sex education distorts information about contraceptives including only revealing failure rates associated with their use and ignoring discussion of their benefits The language surrounding medicine and health is construed as being both objective and value free This objectivity is then adopted by conservative politicians and campaigners to assert authority which historically holds its basis in religionAnother problem for abstinence education is the definition of abstinence Santelli states that there is no strict definition of abstinence within the US federal government guidelines for teaching abstinenceonly sex education using a mixture of nonspecific phrases like postponing sex or never had vaginal sex while also using moralistic terms or phrases like virgin chaste and making a commitment This has resulted in sexual activities that are not penilevaginal including mutual masturbation oral sex and anal sex being considered outside of the scope of abstention from sex which is termed technical virginityThe US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief PEPFAR is the US governments initiative to combat HIVAIDS globally PEPFAR works with the governments of countries worldwide to create sustainable programs to prevent HIV and improve the lives of those suffering PEPFAR provides funding to other countries to help combat HIVAIDS It does so with certain guidelines and restrictions on the recipients PEPFAR promotes an ABC approach Abstain Be faithful and use Condoms Funding recipients may give information about condoms to youth over years old but cannot use the funding to provide condoms or promote usage In countries receiving funds from PEPFAR teens under the age of are not allowed to receive information about condoms The rationale behind this is to not encourage sexual activity despite evidence that condom use does not cause promiscuityPEPFAR was founded in with the mandate that of its funds provided for prevention be used for abstinenceonly education Since the reauthorization in this mandate was removed with a shift toward directives to spend at least on abstinenceonly education The role of parters has been an area of debate surrounding PEPFAR In of all the community partners were faithbased and debate exists over whether the US should be allowing grants specifically written for faithbased organizations and prevention A few countries that have received PEPFAR funding specifically Mozambique and Rwanda have expressed distaste for the US push for faithbased education and abstinenceonly funding Human rights groups have expressed concern that condom availability has decreased since PEPFARs involvement in the global AIDS crisisThe billion that the US government spent on programs to promote abstinence in subSaharan Africa had no meaningful impactIn the US states may apply for federal funding of abstinenceonly sex education programs from either Title V the Adolescent Family Life Act AFLA andor CommunityBased Abstinence Education CBAE To be eligible for funding programs must satisfy requirements given under the Social Security Act which is reproduced here verbatim For purposes of this section the term abstinence education means an educational or motivational program whichFunding which began in the s has continued to increase since its inception though support for the programs and legislation surrounding them has become dependent upon the current administration For example George W Bush administration was supportive of abstinenceonly programs while the Obama administration has worked to decrease funding in order to provide more federal dollars for comprehensive sex educationThe Christian Right who initially stood against having schoolbased sex education programs began supporting abstinenceonly programs due to the focus on marriage As a driving force behind the abstinence movement they have focused on getting more funding for these programs and have also been successful in creating more awareness surrounding abstinence through their use of activism To the New Right the abstinenceonly sex education movement was an opportunity and an avenue to change the current view and status of sexuality in America aligning it more with their own values and as a result creating individuals who remained abstinent until marriage and thus citizens who embodied values of selfdiscipline and morality In addition abstinenceonly programs utilize ideas of individualism and personal responsibility when educating young people about sex seeking to create individuals who take responsibility for sexuality and morality These ideas underlie the basis of conservative ideology a focus on the individual having a strong place in the beliefs of this group Thus it makes sense that support for abstinenceonly programs as an effective form of sex education has been linked to conservative individualsReligious doctrines take varying stances on contraception and premarital sex some of which are covered bydocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid

name of the former Alcatraz penitentiary The coup consists of a deliberate revoke by declarer causing the next player to reveal whether he holds the key card whose location is sought The declarer then corrects the revoke which is allowed without penalty if done soon enough and the defender may change his play but declarer now knows about the key card and can choose how to finesse accordinglyConsider this layout of the club suitSouth wants three tricks from clubs but the opponents have been successful in concealing the location of the Q South calls for the J from dummy and East follows suit with the South now perpetrates the Alcatraz Coup by discarding from a different suit thus committing a revoke ThenPresumably the idea behind the name is that any bridge player attempting the coup should be locked up in a maximum security facility According to a article by Albert MoreheadThe classic hand for the Alcatraz Coup which was not then so called was the following one adduced in by Oswald Jacoby of Dallas who was trying to persuade the laws committees to change the revoke lawThus the name originates some time between and In a article in The Bridge World Kit Woolsey describes a fictitious visit by a bridge expert to a bridge tournament at Alcatraz where he was subject to various tricks by the inmates by means of gaming the system Apparently the coups name inspired Woolsey to write the articleAccording to Moreheads article The laws committees have considered the Alcatraz Coup too unusual a case to be dealt with specifically but it is no less typical of rare irregularities that committees must consider when a new code of laws is being prepared However since when that article was published there have been changes in the Laws so that now a remedy is available for use of the Alcatraz coupThe most relevant change is Law C Law D in the Laws Of Duplicate Bridge which defines information gained from either sides legal withdrawal of a card as unauthorized for the offending side Note although the revoking side may correct its revoke a revoke has nevertheless occurred and therefore there is an offending side It also states that A player of the offending side may not choose from among logical alternative actions one that could demonstrably have been suggested over another by the unauthorized information In other words even if the coup is executed inadvertently the declarer may not take advantage of knowing the position of the queen if he does so the tournament director may adjust the result accordinglyAlso a deliberate infraction of the Laws is normally viewed as a serious violation of the Proprieties that exposes deliberate attempters of the Coup to further sanctionsdocdoc id urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicurid

threedimensional designs inside The image is composed of many small points of fracture or other visible deformations and appears to float inside the blockEach point is created by a laser beam focused to high intensity at that location by a computercontrolled optomechanical system A complex or highly detailed image occupying a cm inch cubic volume typically requires the creation of tens of thousands of such pointsBubblegram images may be created by intersecting laser beams in appropriately doped plastic to induce a chemical reaction via heat or photonic excitation creating bubbles or nodes where the plastic has a different index of refractionGlass block bubblegrams of Russian origin entered international commerce as a novelty in the late s but high prices and the predominantly simple inartistic subject matter severely limited market penetration In the early s a much less expensive more visually appealing and highly diverse array of Chinesemade bubblegram novelties achieved wide commercial success in the United States to the extent of becoming a fad representations of monuments corporate symbols religious imagery mythical creatures and nature scenes appeared in gift

identify people they know in common The game has become something of an informal social custom in the Jewish community and it is often surprisingly easy for strangers who play it to discover mutual acquaintances and establish instant context and connectionAs Etan Diamond observes in his book And I Will Dwell in Their Midst Orthodox Jews in SuburbiaThis game of Jewish geography follows a simple pattern One person asks Youre from insert name of city here Do you know insert persons name here The other one usually responds something like Sure he sits behind my uncle in synagogue or I met her once at a youth group convention or She is really good friends with my sisters college roommate NonJews often find it astonishing that such links are made so easily but given both the relative smallness of the Jewish communityand the even smaller size of the Orthodox Jewish communityand the extensive overlapping social circles within these communities it should not surprise too much p xvSonia Pressman Fuentes describes it in her memoir Eat FirstYou Dont Know What Theyll Give You The Adventures of an Immigrant Family and Their Feminist Daughter When two or more Jews meet who share a connection to a particular locality they will question each other until they find that they know or know of at least one other Jew in commonAn Israeli version of the game pitsuchim has been a common pastime among young Israeli backpackers traveling the world taking its name from a s television quiz showAnother similar social game called The rule of communicated Datis Hebrew for religious orthodox Jews is used by Zionist religious orthodox Jews and a movie mocking the game called by that name has been produced by students of the Maale school for video and mediaThe game is a form of testing the Smallworld experimentThe origins of Jewish geography are unclear Sarah Benor a linguist and professor of Jewish Studies at Hebrew Union College has noted Sometimes that kind of thing is really impossible to findThe term Jewish geography not only functions as the name of the game but also describes the unique smallness and closeness of the worldwide Jewish population The Jewish populations Jewish geography therefore is what makes the game possible and lets Jews from different cities regions and countries easily discover people they know in commonBoth the game and the concept are Jewishspecific examples of the six degrees of separation theory proposed by Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy in and the small world phenomenon hypothesized by social scientist Stanley Milgram in While the accuracy of these theories have been questioned by some few Jews doubt the validity of Jewish geography having observed its connective power firsthanddocdoc id
